Awww! The 23-year-old said in a January Rolling Stone interview that she’s “beyond done” talking about her relationship with the Biebs, but she clearly still has a soft spot for him in there somewhere!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The 23-year-old said in a January&nbsp;Rolling Stone interview that she’s “beyond done” talking about her relationship with the Biebs, but she clearly still has&nbsp;a soft spot for him in there somewhere! These two were last seen together at the end of November — remember their romantic PDA-filled night at the Montage Beverly Hills, followed by the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Music Award</a>s after-party they were both at two days later? — and even though the “Sorry” singer has tried to move on with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hailey Baldwin</a></strong>, 19, he’s clearly holding every girl to a high standard thanks to his first love.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Unfortunately for Hailey, Justin just doesn’t have the same sort of feeling for her that he did for Selena,” a source told us EXCLUSIVELY. “He’s still searching for a girl who makes him feel like she did.” Selena, it seems, has been working to find love again, too: She was first linked to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Niall Horan</a></strong>, 22, at the beginning of December, and has recently been seen hanging out — and holding hands with!! —&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Samuel Krost</a></strong>. Could she finally have a new man!?&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do YOU think of Justin’s hair? What’s your favorite color on him?
