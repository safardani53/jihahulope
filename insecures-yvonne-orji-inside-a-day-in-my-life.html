After finishing a five-season run as Molly Carter on HBO’s Insecure, Yvonne Orji is already gearing up for her next project – and she brought Us Weekly along for a day in her life as a successful actress and producer.
While Orji, 38, exclusively revealed to Us that she is “preparing for a few new roles,” her latest project is Netflix’s upcoming drama — which she is set to both produce and star in."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After finishing a five-season run as Molly Carter on HBO’s <a href=#>Insecure</a>, <a href=#><strong>Yvonne Orji</strong> </a>is already gearing up for her next project – and she brought Us Weekly along for a day in her life as a successful actress and producer.</p><p>While Orji, 38, exclusively revealed to Us that she is “preparing for a few new roles,” her latest project is Netflix’s upcoming drama — which she is set to both produce and star in.</p><p>Stronger will center <a href=#>around female empowerment</a> and bodybuilding. The series is created and written by Up In the Air’s <strong>Sheldon Turner</strong> and comes from A+E Studios.</p><p>Per<a href=#> Deadline</a>, the show will seemingly follow Toni Winslow (Orji), “a single mom who feels unseen and unimportant” who becomes “obsessed with bodybuilding as she explores the surprisingly tenuous line separating self-empowerment from self-destruction.”</p><p>Playing <a href=#>strong female characters</a> is nothing new for the Nigeria native, whose portrayal of Molly in Insecure became a standout performance over the show’s six-year run.</p><p>“You turn<i>&nbsp;</i>Insecure<i>&nbsp;</i>on and you see a sea of brown. You see at the core of it a strong friendship between two brown-skinned girls” Orji told the <a href=#>Huffington Post</a> in July 2017. “Me and<a href=#><strong> Issa [Rae]</strong></a> talk about this a lot; she has great friends and she wanted to show friends like that who are dope and amazing and [for people to] be able to see a relationship that is supported.”</p><p>The Night School star continued, “Black girls can make the best girlfriends. Sometimes you need someone who’s gonna listen to you and let you do your own thing like Issa and Molly.”</p><p>Orji isn’t just a pro in front of the camera. The actress is also well versed in stand-up&nbsp;— one of her favorite things to do. “Whether I’m on set or upon the stage, I truly feel like my most authentic self when I’m able to help others and make them laugh,” she told Us.</p><p>While Orji may be busy and on the go, she never <a href=#>forgets to take time for self-care</a>. Whether it’s stopping to — literally — smell the roses or reflecting on her day through journaling, she understands the importance of mindfulness.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It helps me to take a moment to pray, give thanks and to make sure I’m starting the day putting me first,” she explained.</p><p>Scroll down to check out a day in Orji’s life:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktq%2B%2FxJysq52jYsa3u82nnGanop%2B2brXNrKCdnV2WeqWt2Gagp2WdrnqttcWeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
