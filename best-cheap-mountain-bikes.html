Just because you're not paying top dollar, doesn't mean you should have to compromise on safety or style.</p><h2>What should I look for in a mountain bike?</h2><p>In the £500-£1,000 price category, most bikes are hardtails (meaning they only have front suspension) and have an aluminium frame, but you will get hydraulic disc brakes for your money.</p><p>Other things to look out for include the number of gears – more isn’t always better and a 1x set-up, where you only have one front chainring, can often leave you with a lighter, more efficient drivetrain.</p><p>Also, the inclusion of dropper post routing is great if you plan to have the bike for the long haul and upgrade as you progress.</p><h2><strong>1.

Grand Canyon 5 Mountain Bike</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/full_2021_grand-canyon-5_2613_bu-bk_P5.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Grand Canyon 5, £849 at Canyon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This German manufacturer-to-consumer brand is renowned for being able to offer up amazing value thanks to cutting out the middleman.</p><p>It's one of the more expensive bikes on this list, but it holds up against much pricier bikes with its robust but lightweight aluminium frame, balanced geometry and outstanding components.</p><p>Complete with a suspension fork and powerful disc brakes, you can feel safe and confident as you set out for the trails.</p><p>The trail-proven Grand Canyon 5 is affordable but by no means an "entry-level" bike.</p><h2>How much does a decent mountain bike cost?</h2><p>Spending between £450-£700 will get you something that is not only good value but will help you to develop your skills as a mountain biker.</p><p>The quality of the main components (frame, fork, drivetrain, brakes) improve the closer you get to the £1,000 marker, providing you with a solid skeleton that can be upgraded as your riding improves.</p><p>This price range means that all will qualify for the cycle-to-work scheme allowance too, with mountain bikes making a comfortable choice for a short or scenic commute.</p><h2>Can a mountain bike be used on the road?</h2><p>There’s nothing stopping you from using a mountain bike on the road, and many who don’t have the luxury of owning different bikes for different types of riding will use a mountain bike for all sorts – be it commuting, getting from A-to-B or long-distance touring.</p><p>If you’re only going to be riding on the road though, a hybrid or road bike might be better suited to your needs as they will generally be faster on tarmac than a mountain bike thanks to tyres with better rolling resistance and road-specific gearing.</p><h2>What size mountain bike is right for me?</h2><p><span>To make sure you get the right-size bike for you, you've got to measure yourself using a tape measure and, ideally, a spirit level and apply that data to a sizing chart.</span></p><p><span>Tredz has a very </span><a href=#><span>useful sizing guide</span></a><span> which you can use to make sure you get the perfect fit.</span></p><h2>How can I improve my cheap mountain bike?</h2><p>While all of the above bikes are a solid starting point, there is a reason why they are the price they are. Brands will generally focus on the big-ticket items (frame, fork, wheels, drivetrain) and keep the cost down by finishing the bike with lower-spec or own-brand kit.</p><p>The first thing to change that will make the biggest difference is the bike's tyres. If sold as tubeless-ready, that could be as simple as setting them up as tubeless with a <a href=#>conversion kit</a>, which allows you to run lower tyre pressures, improving grip and reducing the risk of punctures in the process.</p><p>Other cost-effective ways of instantly improving your stock mountain bike include replacing the grips, installing a set of clipless pedals and getting your suspension tuned and serviced, while slightly more expensive changes include new handlebars, saddle and even installing a dropper seat post.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More from Sun Selects Health and Fitness</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our roundup of the best cheap mountain bikes for 2022?
