“Everybody on camera is doing this s–t, I just wanted to be real about it,” Schumer, 40, told The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday, March 8, noting that she went under the knife because her “uterus didn’t contract for two and a half years” after giving birth.

The doctor found 30 spots of endometriosis that he removed. He removed my appendix because the endometriosis had attacked it. There was a lot, a lot of blood in my uterus and I’m, you know, sore and I have some, like, gas pains.
