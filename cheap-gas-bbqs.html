The more burners it has, the more people you can cook for at the same time and the more versatile the machine is.</p><p>But if you only have a small patio, or will generally only cook for a few people, look for something small and compact but with at least two burners.</p><p>You can also get portable barbecues that are great for camping trips.</p><p>Once you’ve decided on the size and number of burners, it’s time to think about additional features.</p><p>Some barbecues have a side burner that allows you to cook or warm other food at the same time, just like a hob at home.</p><p>While others feature a “flavouriser bar” or lava rocks, basically an extra surface over the gas that catches all the fat, sauces, and juices from the food.</p><p>When these evaporate, they help recreate the smoky barbecue flavour that you get in charcoal barbecues.</p><p>If you might need to move your barbecue around your garden, or in and out of storage, it’s worth going for one with wheels too.</p><p>And of course, you should look for hooks, rails and shelves in convenient places that will let you hang tongs and towels or rest plates of food.</p><h2>How much do gas BBQs cost?</h2><p>Prices for gas barbecues can vary enormously, from less than £100 to several thousand. It all depends on whether you’re buying branded versions and what features are included.</p><p>As proven by our list of cheap gas BBQs, you can get yourself a decent-sized barbecue for around £200 if you hunt for a bargain.</p><h2>Where to buy cheap gas BBQs</h2><p>Head to one of these online retailers to get a great deal on a gas BBQ for the summer:</p><h2>What is the best cheap gas BBQ?</h2><p>This is really dependent on which features are most important to you, the size of your space and the numbers you're hoping to cook for.</p><p>Overall, we would recommend the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Argos Home 2-burner</a> for the volume of features for the price - or the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Argos Home Wow 6-burner BBQ,</a> which is also a great price for such a large cooking area.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFwaWV%2FeX%2BOnJ%2BemaBitKK%2FjJuZqqtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
