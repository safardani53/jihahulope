Here's which characters are in peril.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Showtime</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert! This article contains spoilers for Season 2 of Showtime's </strong><strong>Yellowjackets</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Season 1 of <a href=# style=text-align:start>Yellowjackets </a>shocked fans with the deaths of <a href=# style=text-align:start>Jackie Taylor (Ella Purnell)</a> and <a href=# style=text-align:start>Adult Travis Martinez (Andres Soto)</a>, but Season 2 has since upped the ante with the deaths of a few more characters. The intensity of the show has only upped since Season 2, Episode 8, where the girls in the 1996 timeline officially start hunting one another for food.</p><p>So, who dies in Yellowjackets Season 2? The season was rife with heartbreaking deaths, especially towards the end. Let's review the material and see which characters the wilderness has chosen.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Showtime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who dies in 'Yellowjackets' Season 2? Here's a breakdown of the season.</h2><p>During Episode 2, the girls in the wilderness timeline began to spiral after consuming Jackie's body. Things further escalated with Shauna's pregnancy and Javi's return from the wilderness. Several characters have had near-miss experiences with death throughout the season, including Teen Lottie, Teen Shauna, and Teen Nat.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Crystal/Kristen.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Showtime</span></figure><p>Misty's first (and only?) true friend in the cabin, this duo started annoying one another and ended with poor Kristen falling off a cliff. As the pair grew close enough for "Crystal" to reveal that she had been called by the wrong name the whole time, Misty felt comfortable enough to reveal her truest secret: that she had disabled the black box transmitter from the airplane, potentially preventing them from being found.</p><p>When Kristen understandably gets upset with Misty for stranding them all in the wilderness, she slips and falls over the cliff's edge. Even more upsetting, Misty urges the other girls to help her "find" Kristen, when she knew that Kristen's body was at the bottom of the ravine all along — or is it? Misty tried to dig through the snow to find her again, but unfortunately, her body seems to be missing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Javi.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Showtime</span></figure><p>After mysteriously returning from the wildness and refusing to talk to anyone, fans always felt uneasy about Javi's fate. Seeing him back with his brother, Travis, was heartwarming, but that happiness didn't last long.</p><p>In a genuinely tear-jerking moment, Javi speaks up and attempts to save Natalie from being hunted by the rest of the group, only to fall through the lake's ice. He drowns and effectively takes Nat's place as the sacrifice, leaving many fans devastated.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kevyn Tan.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Showtime</span></figure><p>Kevyn Tan only wanted to solve a murder, but is inevitably murdered himself. When Walter discovers Kevyn poking around, he poisons him and frames him for embezzlement. Then, Walter tells creepy Matt Saracusa that he has enough dirt where Matt could go back to the police as a hero, or he could go down with Kevyn and lose his job.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Natalie.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Showtime</span></figure><p>Poor Natalie. Many viewers predicted her death in the finale, which took place during a "hunt" in which Shauna pulls the infamous Queen card. Lisa confronts the group in the woods after Lottie is shot in the arm by Callie, and Misty attempts to attack Lisa with a syringe full of fentanyl (her signature weapon of choice).</p><p>Ultimately, it was just as fans predicted, and rather than allow Lisa to fall in harm's way, Natalie jumps in front of her and ends up on the receiving end of Misty's syringe. Natalie dies, leaving the rest of the Yellowjackets to pick up the pieces.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecOinKxlmaN6urHLpaawopGYuKbA0maqnpmjpLtufg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
