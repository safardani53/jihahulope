On Selling Sunset, we definitely turn up for y’all. We are definitely glam girls. We love to bring the fashion, so we get glammed to film, for the most part … and it is out of our pockets.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Netflix star added: “No one pays for our glam. Nobody pays for our outfits. Some of the girls have stylists. I myself do not. I dress and style myself. That’s why if you see me looking crazy, it’s my fault and my fault only. In the real world, however, I’m probably just going to throw on a hoodie and chill in the house.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In addition to the fashion, season 6 delivered drama as the women of the high-end real estate agency fought over friendships, careers and more.

Heather’s pregnancy and Chrishell’s romance with <a href=#><strong>G Flip</strong></a> were also major story lines.
