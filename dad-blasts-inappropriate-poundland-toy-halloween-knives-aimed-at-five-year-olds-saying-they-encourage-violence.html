John, who has asked us not to use his last name, blasted the budget retailer for pushing the products ahead of Halloween on Monday because they promote violence.
The 50-year-old's wife, Joanne, spotted the gruesome accessories in the store in Folkestone, Kent, on Friday and immediately complained to shop floor staff."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We just think it's morally wrong to be selling something like that.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Related stories</h2></p><p>"The knives are retractable and come with a load of fake blood.</p><p>"Any parent who buys that for their kids is just&nbsp;irresponsible.</p><p>"My wife mentioned it to the staff but they said she had to contact head office but they just said 'we'll look into it' and that was it. They didn't seem to take her complaint very seriously."</p><p>The couple, who moved to Kent to get out of Tottenham, north London, because of its rising crime rate,&nbsp;have two children aged 22 and 24.</p><p>According to the Metropolitan Police website in August this year there were 194 crimes in that area, increasing to 220 in September.</p><p>John added: "I don't think it is right at all. We used to live in a place where stabbings were&nbsp;rife. The packet says it is suitable for ages five and up which is just disgusting. I know kids like a prank and a joke but thinking it is a joke to stab someone is not funny, it is morally wrong."</p><p>A spokeswoman for Poundland said: "<span lang=en-gb>We can confirm the item is part of our current toy Halloween department.
