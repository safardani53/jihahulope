It's always hilarious whenever reality TV shows create these little arbitrary measurement systems in order to add more depth to their shows. Oftentimes it's a rating system that is steeped in evaluation methods that would be deemed shaky at best, and we're not just talking about Nielsen numbers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Seriously, what is it based on?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">PSR on 'Naked and Afraid' stands for primitive survival rating.</h2><p>A contestant's "PSR" is used by the show to indicate how likely they are to succeed in the wild based on whatever skills they possess. Fans of Naked and Afraid can get a taste of their own PSR by taking <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the program's quiz.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Participants are presented with a series of questions that pertain to being stranded in the wild with nothing but your own wits and instincts to guide you to see how long you would last on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The show ascertains each individual competitor's Primitive Survival Rating on a slew of different factors that are broken up into three general categories: mental acumen, experience in the outdoors, and developed skills.&nbsp;</p><p>These scores are more or less based on the same types of questions found in a variety of different <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"survivalist" online quizzes</a>.</p><p>For some reason or another folks seem to be obsessed with the idea of whether or not they can survive in extreme living scenarios, or if they ever had to live "off the grid" in a completely sustainable way.&nbsp;</p><p>I'd argue that there's enough "wilderness" in everyday life to conquer and if you're crazy enough to thrive (and not just survive) in the wacky global society we've created, you'll figure out how to navigate the wilderness just fine.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who has had the top PSRs in 'Naked and Afraid' history?</h2><p>Alums<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> EJ "Skullcrusher" Synder</a> and Laura Zerra are tied for the top spot, with PSRs of 9.1 EJ and Laura have both appeared on Naked and Afraid three times, including the first season of XL in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you need a recap, EJ survived 21 days in Tanzania during Season 1 while Laura lasted 21 days in the Panamanian jungle.

That honor goes to Cassie DePecol, who earned a 3.4 in Season 1, and only made it the entire three weeks thanks to the help of her three teammates.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you think you could survive in the wilderness for 21 days without any clothing, food, or water?
