A typical meal aimed at children aged two to five has 609 calories – almost double the recommended 364, say researchers at Roehampton University and the Cork Institute of Technology.
While dishes for older kids were also more than 100 calories over the guideline.
Lynsey Hope and her children Jacob, five, and Olive, two, went to some of the UK’s most popular chains to find out which have the most options, offer best value for money and, most importantly, are the healthiest."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Juice, a milkshake, water or soft drink included.</p><p><strong>COST:</strong> £6.95 plus £1 for ice cream</p><p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT:</strong> Chicken burger with skinny fries and water: 12.7g saturated fat, 763 calories. Burger with skinny fries and Oreo milkshake: 23.1g saturated fat, 1,335 cals.</p><p><strong>Lynsey says:</strong> Jacob chose cheeseburger without cheese but he only ate a couple of mouthfuls of the burger and filled up on the bun. It felt a like a lot of money for a burger and chips when you can buy a McDonald’s Happy Meal for less than half the price. Just carrot or cucumber sticks would have been a better side.<br><strong>4/10</strong></p><p><strong>Jacob says:</strong> I didn’t like the burger but I loved the bun. I liked colouring while we were waiting for our dinner.<br><strong>4/10</strong></p><p><strong>Amanda says:</strong> You would expect burgers on this menu and from a nutritionist’s point of view, the best advice is to keep them as plain as possible. Chicken and veggie burger make good alternatives. While there is a green salad option, most kids will prefer fries. Pudding is limited to two scoops of ice cream, which limits the calorie intake.<br><strong>6/10</strong></p><h2>Bella Italia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000500254612.jpg><p><strong>THE OFFER</strong>: Two kids’ menus – one for two to six-year-olds and bigger portions for seven to 11-year-olds. Starters include breadsticks with carrot and cucumber and cheesy garlic bread. Meals on offer include Fish ‘n’ Chips, Calzone, and little ones can create their own pizza or pasta sauce. Dessert – which can be a trip to the gelato cart – and drink included.</p><p><strong>COST:</strong> £5.95 for younger kids, £7.95 for older children</p><p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT:</strong> Vegetable sticks with tomato dip, pasta with tomato sauce followed by a Chilly Billy ice lolly: 0.9g saturated fat, 278 cals. Cheesy garlic bread, pepperoni pizza, doughnut: 20.9g saturated fat, 694 ­cals.</p><p><strong>Lynsey says:</strong> There’s a good selection but my kids just wanted a margherita. The pizza was thick and stodgy. The “make your own” elements are a great idea and the ice cream cart was fun.<br><strong>4/10</strong></p><p><strong>Jacob says:</strong> I liked my pizza but the crusts were a bit dry. The best bit was the ice cream.<br><strong>5/10</strong></p><p><strong>Amanda</strong>&nbsp;<strong>says:</strong> I like that the menu is divided into two age groups Good choices include bread sticks, vegetable sticks and tomato dip followed by pasta with tomato sauce with extra toppings of mushrooms and pea, prawns or chicken.<br><strong>7/10</strong></p><h2>Wagamama - The healthiest</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000500253148.jpg><p><strong>THE OFFER:</strong> Kids’ dishes include chicken ramen, mini chicken katsu with curry sauce, mini grilled chicken noodles and crispy fish bites. Desserts and drinks cost extra.</p><p><strong>COST:</strong> From £3.95 to £5.25 and a free Cococino</p><p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT:</strong> Grilled fish noodles, ko fruit pop and glass of milk: 5.3g saturated fat, 594 cals. Crispy fish bites, vanilla ice cream and juice: 7.6g saturated fat, 805 cals.</p><p><strong>Lynsey says:</strong> My two loved the crispy fish bites, which comes with sticky white rice, carrots, cucumber and sweetcorn. Olive couldn’t finish her portion, so not the best value for money. The selection of dishes is better suited to slightly older children.<br><strong>8/10</strong></p><p><strong>Jacob says</strong>: I loved the crispy fish, it was delicious and the rice was yummy.<br><strong>7/10</strong></p><p><strong>Amanda says:</strong> Wagamama offer nutritious choices which include protein, a healthy carb and veg combo. It also scores well on the pudding front. With the choice of a fruit juice or ice cream, both give children a sweet ending to their meal in sensible serving sizes and don’t overload them with sugar.<br><strong>9/10</strong></p><h2>Pizza Express</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000500248500.jpg><p><strong>THE OFFER:</strong> Dough balls to start and then children can choose from pizza, pasta or salad and a dessert. Meals include bolognese, margherita pizza, pollo salad and the American pizza with pepperoni.</p><p><strong>COST:</strong> £7.25 for three courses and a Bambinoccino</p><p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT:</strong> Dough balls with crudites, pasta bolognese, fruity ice lolly: 3.8g saturated fat, 446 cals. Dough balls with butter, American pizza, chocolate brownie: 18.9g saturated fat, 913 cals.</p><p><strong>Lynsey says:</strong> The dough balls came with cucumber and tomatoes. They both had a margherita pizza. Jacob wanted a chocolate brownie for pudding, which came with strawberries. Olive chose the Rainbow ice lolly which contains fruit and hidden veg, but she wasn’t keen.<br><strong>8/10</strong></p><p><strong>Jacob</strong> <strong>says</strong>: I liked the dough balls and the pizza was delicious.<br><strong>9/10</strong></p><p><strong>Amanda says:</strong> Healthy options would be the dough balls and crudite with a margherita pizza or a simple pasta bolognese. The Bambinoccino is a great way of boosting calcium and avoiding sugar rich drinks.<br><strong>8/10</strong></p><h2>Harvester</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000500247753.jpg><p><strong>THE OFFER:</strong> Smaller bites for under five including fish fingers and and two chipolata sausages with a Yorkshire pudding and gravy. Bigger bites for seven and under include a mini beef burger and butter-milk fried chicken. Older kids can enjoy a 4oz rump steak or BBQ chicken.

From £5.99 for over sevens</p><p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT:</strong> Fish fingers with jacket potato and baked beans, fruit salad: 1.4g saturated fat, 622 cals. Sausage and Yorkshire pudding with mash potato, Build Your Own Cookie: 21.9g saturated fat, 897 cals.</p><p><strong>Lynsey says</strong>: The salad cart is unlimited, so they were able to have plenty of cucumber and tomatoes to up their veg intake. They chose the smaller portion so they both did a good job of cleaning the plates.<br><strong>7/10</strong></p><p><strong>Jacob says:</strong> Yorkshire puddings are my favourite – and I finished Olive’s. I also liked going up to the salad cart.<br><strong>6/10</strong></p><p><strong>Amanda says</strong>: The chain is to be commended for splitting their menu into age groups. It’s the sides where things can go wrong – triple-cooked chips add fat and calories.<br><strong>8/10</strong></p><h2>Nando's - The tastiest</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000499252980.jpg><p><strong>THE OFFER:</strong> You can choose a main meal with two sides and either a dessert or drink. Meals include chicken burger, chicken breast fillet or chicken wings with sides.</p><p><strong>COST:</strong> £5.95 for a meal with two sides and either a dessert or drink</p><p><strong>WHAT’S</strong>&nbsp;<strong>IN IT:</strong> Chicken fillet with sweet potato mash and broccoli followed by watermelon: 0.7g saturated fat, 254 cals. Chicken burger with chips and gelado: 11.4g saturated fat, 790 cals.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p><strong>Lynsey says</strong>: The chicken burger was a real hit and I loved the selection of sides. Both had the burger with broccoli. Olive had a corn on the cob which she loved and Jacob had chips. My favourite meal so far.</p><p><strong>9/10</strong></p><p><strong>Jacob says</strong>: I loved my chicken burger and my sister really liked her corn on the cob too.</p><p><strong>10/10</strong></p><p><strong>Amanda says</strong>: You have to be strict to make sure you get the most nutritious options. A chicken fillet with sweet potato mash, broccoli and corn on the cob is a great meal. Equally, you could choose a chicken burger, chips and frozen yoghurt. This could leave your child consuming their days’ total fat, salt, calories and sugar in a single meal.<br><strong>7/10</strong></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Parents on Eat Well For Less reveal they spend a staggering £365 a week cooking five different meals a night for their fussy family</span><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e8Wopp1naWl%2BdXyScGanmZ6ZvLR51pqemqWRoq5ursSsq2aen6SxbrLOq2SkoZSofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
