Shame on you after what I did for you, for your children -- helped make you a lot of money," she said of the Dance Moms families.</p><p>"You couldn‚Äôt come to visit me for eight and a half months? You couldn‚Äôt send a card, a letter?"</p><p>She continued: "I was getting mail from children in other countries and somehow, twelve-and thirteen-year-old little girls were finding the address.</p><p>"They were getting their&nbsp;cards and letters to me, and people here, that I taught their children before the television show --&nbsp;they were very happy customers before&nbsp;Dance Moms&nbsp;and then during it, they were stars, they were making money, they were on top of the world -- and you‚Äôre just going to dump me?"</p><p>"It‚Äôs not hurtful anymore, because you realize real quick who your friends are," Miller added.</p><p>Later on, Miller revealed that she now teaches dance lessons over <a href=#>Zoom</a> to children all over the world.</p><p>"I teach on Zoom all over the world, and I&nbsp;can critique and pick out everything.

I am forever indebted and grateful to have the decades of memories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the original ALDC - While I wish I could hold onto every piece of history in that studio, it is just impossible and I want to share as much as I can with YOU the fans, family and supporters of the Abby Lee Dance Company," she <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">captioned</a> her video.</p><p>"Follow&nbsp;@thecleanoutkrew&nbsp;and stay tuned for more information on the upcoming online auction available worldwide! üëèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è"</p><p>The auction began on Friday, January 26, with bidding open until February 8.</p><p>Proceeds will benefit Dancers Against Cancer.</p><h2>Why is Abby Lee Miller in a wheelchair?</h2><p>In 2018, Miller began a public battle with Burkitt's Lymphoma, a rare type of <a href=#>cancer</a>.</p><p>As a result, she lost her mobility and had to be confined to a wheelchair.</p><p>Since then, Miller has found a new perspective on life, telling ET it has changed&nbsp;"immensely."</p><p>"I say please and thank you at least 100 times a day and to strangers. When you are in a store, and I get caught in between the clothing racks, getting poked in the eye by the edges of hangers, just dropping things on the floor, dropping my car keys in the parking lot. All of those things become a huge problem. They are problematic," she said.</p><p>"It is&nbsp;an effort for me to bend over and try to pick something up off the floor. I can do it, but I have to lower my chair and lower my feet down and I have to lift up the arm rest. I have to bend over and try to grab it."</p><p>"I have such a respect for people that are handicap. I had no idea -- none before I was in the chair, and you see me out --- we bumped into each other at a concert,&nbsp;and I like I said, I go to dinner, I shop, I do this, I do that," she added.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"[I'm] thankful and grateful for the people in my life -- the people that stood by me through thick and thin, through all of this," Miller continued.</p><p>"I love them dearly, and for the strangers, there is an old Irish proverb when you need a favor ask a stranger.
