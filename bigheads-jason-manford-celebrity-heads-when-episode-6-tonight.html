He isn’t really known for his sense of humour, but that would be the greatest advert for the show.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhrZGaFdX6QaJmin5iarqW%2FjKOYrKeeYrqiusWoqZ1lk5q5pq7RoquyZZiarqW%2FjLCfnqZdmr2qv86dnGZuXam8r7XGoato</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
