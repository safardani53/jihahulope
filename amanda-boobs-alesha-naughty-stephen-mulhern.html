It was an incredible experience. I loved it.</p><p>“Was I gutted when it went? Of course. I don’t believe any presenter wouldn’t be.</p><p>“The only bonus that I take from it is that I am pleased they didn’t get another presenter, as that would have been heartbreaking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ff0f7d10-6e70-4ba8-8d4c-8ceea9a626af.jpg><p>“And if they did, I would have loved to know who they would have got.”</p><p>Stephen, who has previously said <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, <a href=#>David Walliams</a>, Ant and Dec all disagreed with the decision, adds: “When BGMT did go, Amanda was one of the first to send me a text saying, ‘It’s just nuts and we are going to miss you lots’.</p><p>“I will remember that for a very long time.”</p><p>Stephen returns to screens this week with game show Rolling In It.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a1abd635-a8f4-46fb-b052-a5891cb3c1b0.jpg><p>It is an entertainment format he knows well, having also presented Catchphrase, In For A Penny and Big Star’s Little Star over his 20 years in the business.</p><p>But he says his latest series is his favourite so far.</p><p>A game of chance, Rolling In It sees three contestants play alongside some of their favourite celebrities and rolling a coin down a moving conveyor belt, with big cash prizes up for grabs.</p><p>It will feature appearances from big names including comedian Jimmy Carr, Towie star turned presenter <a href=#>Mark Wright</a> and reality TV favourite <a href=#>Gemma Collins</a>.</p><h2>‘I HAD GOOSEBUMPS'</h2><p>Stephen, who cut his showbiz teeth as a Butlins Red Coat, says: “This is my favourite show without question, without a doubt.</p><p>“When it came to actually filming the show, I’ve seen every game show you can name.</p><p>“I walked off after the first episode and had goosebumps. I genuinely got emotional. I feel like this is a really special show.

I’m trying to think if any co-presenter has been a nightmare. I’ve really lucked out there.</p><p>“Sometimes it’s nice to do it with someone else and other times it’s nice to do it on your own.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600394918.jpg><p>But for his favourite career moment he chooses his Royal Variety Performance in 2014 in front of the Queen at the Victoria Palace Theatre in the West End.</p><p>He had previously performed there aged 20 in 1997 after winning The Big Big Talent Show, hosted by <a href=#>Jonathan Ross</a>, with his magic act.</p><p>Bringing out his magic tricks again in 2014, Stephen shared a dressing room with Simon Cowell — and he reveals it was not all it was cracked up to be.</p><p>He jokes: “I was there on my lonesome and he has an entourage that is bigger than my family.”</p><h2>‘I WOULD BEAT ANT AND DEC ON CATCHPHRASE’</h2><p>But he would be happy to share a room with Ant and Dec.</p><p>As Catchphrase returns for another series, Stephen says he is eager to get the boys on for a charity special.</p><p>And he would be happy to take them on himself.</p><p>When asked if he would ever consider being a contestant on the show, he says: “The answer is yes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a5557cea-92bd-4263-b209-2ff9dd106b6e.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Showbiz</h2></p><p>“If I was against Ant and Dec I would beat them on Catchphrase 100 per cent.
