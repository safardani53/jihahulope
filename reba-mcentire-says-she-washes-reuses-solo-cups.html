But I love Solo cups,” the “Last One to Know” songstress, 68, told <a href=#><strong>Willie Geist</strong></a> during a Sunday, April 23, episode of&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Sunday Today</i></a>, noting she takes<a href=#> a laid-back approach to planning parties</a><i><a href=#>.</a>&nbsp;</i>“I think that’s the main message of [my new lifestyle] book — don’t not have a party because everything doesn’t look right, or you didn’t have time to get this ready. Just go have fun.”</p><p class=p1>McEntire — who makes sure to <a href=#>stock “lotsa Solo cups” at her family gatherings</a> — even revealed the inspiration behind her party-planning skills.</p><p class=p1>“I got that from Mama. At Thanksgiving, <a href=#>everybody wrote their name with a magic marker</a> on their Solo cup, and that way you didn’t have to waste a lotta cups, gettin’ a new one, and you knew which one was yours,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Voice&nbsp;</i></a>mentor, who shares son Shelby with <a href=#>ex-husband <strong>Narvel Blackstock</strong></a>, recalled on Sunday. “And next Thanksgiving you look for your cup, ‘cause it’s still there.”</p><p class=p1>Geist, 47, was not completely sure if McEntire seriously <a href=#>saved the plastic cups</a>. He asked: “Oh, really? It stays, OK, you keep it, wash it out, put it up on the shelf.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Reba&nbsp;</i>alum</a> then confirmed that she “still” washes the drinkware to have them ready to go for the next family parties.</p><p class=p1>“That is awesome. I love that,” the NBC anchor quipped in delight.</p><p class=p1>McEntire has long been a culinary enthusiast, even <a href=#>opening her own eatery</a> Reba’s Place in Oklahoma in January.</p><p class=p1>“If you’re driving from Dallas up to Tulsa, you’re gonna pass&nbsp;through Atoka, and if you take a right on Main Street, right up on the left, is Reba’s Place,” the&nbsp;<i>Big Sky&nbsp;</i>actress told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Southern Living</a>&nbsp;</i>in February of opening a restaurant in her hometown. “So we were guaranteed, if not being a destination, but as someplace to stop on the way to a destination.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “[There’s] small entertainment. It’s not like big bands coming in. It’s acoustic. I didn’t want it loud so people can sit and still enjoy the music but can still talk in the meantime.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The “I’m a Survivor” musician even bonded with her boyfriend, <a href=#><strong>Rex Linn</strong></a>, over their similar tastes.</p><p class=p1>“Our Valentine’s meal last year was Sonic tater tots,” McEntire told <a href=#><strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong></a> on<a href=#>&nbsp;<i>Today With Hoda and Jenna&nbsp;</i></a>earlier this month. “Well, [with]<a href=#> my nickname being ‘tater tot’ and his being ‘sugar tot,’</a> we love Sonic tater tots. They’re wonderful.&nbsp;And to go in there and get a No. 1 cheeseburger with everything on it and tater tots, man, that’s a great Valentine’s dinner. We loved it. We sat right there in the car and ate it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqudkpZ6rq%2FEp6uiqpViwKLF0maqoZ1drK60tMSsZKudpaiytHnSqKOoZZOqvbR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
