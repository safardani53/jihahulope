I found an artificial olive tree for £49.99, a 120cm artificial Yucca for £24.99 and a 30cm pink rose ball for £9.99.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the gold bunnies I fell in love with this bird bath and couldn't get over the price!</p><p>£14.99 for a stunning bird bath of this size? This would easily be £30+ elsewhere. It had to go in my basket.</p><p>I also purchased the Jacquard outdoor rug for £17.99 - it comes in black and grey. I was really happy with the design, size and material.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>B&M</strong></h2><p>If you love gonks B&M offer so many gonk and gnome garden items. They have these adorable gonks that hold an LED lantern for £15 and another for £12.</p><p>They have an amazing selection of bird nests, baths and feeders. There’s a bright red robin feeder for £5, an open nest teapot for £8, a floral glass feeder for £5 and a dome robin bird feeder at just £4.</p><p>I purchased one that has suction cups and you can attach to your window for a bit of live cat TV for my cats.&nbsp;</p><p>What sets B&M apart from competitors is the fact they stock outdoor cushions with prices starting at £10.</p><p>They have a huge selection in different ranges, I personally love the Eden range with greenery but there's also bright papaya prints. You can then match your items with the</p><p>same range in tumblers and plates staring at just £2 for a plate.</p><p>I have to say B&M had the best designs on plates, blankets, cushions etc but they did cost more than Poundland & Home Bargains.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>They have really good quality products and I find them to be the most High- End and trendy.&nbsp;</p><p>Follow me on YouTube for more @<a href=# aria-label="LiyanaLifestyle (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">LiyanaLifestyle</a>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/s-exactly-need-get-hands-826359630.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/s-exactly-need-get-hands-826359637.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/s-exactly-need-get-hands-826359523-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Frbm5raGaDcLzOrqWdpJGjsW6%2F1Kmcq56Ro3q0vMSnm2ZtYGV6qLHTZp%2BappSoerC6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
