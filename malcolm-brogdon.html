data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon lived in the two-story colonial at 547 Auburn Avenue, just off the corner of Howell Street, two miles east of the Hawks’ arena, from age eight to thirteen.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His family moved there from the suburbs in 2001, and his parents, Jann Adams and Gino Brogdon Sr., immediately built a basketball court for their three sons behind the house.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It was just a concrete slab the width of a minivan, with a right-wing that split into a nearby driveway and a hoop weighed down by bricks at the base.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/malcolm-brogdon-mother-1024x1024.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon describes himself as a “rambunctious kid,” nicknamed Mookie Dew by his father for his ability to zip around like Mookie Blaylock, the Hawks’ 1.82 m jetpack.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Naturally, this resulted in an odd injury, such as an upper incisor that remains chipped due to a hard foul by a neighbourhood friend.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On the other hand, Malcolm trudged inside for dinner with invisible scars and gushing tears because older brothers Gino Jr. and John would never let him win.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Initiation Of Basketball Interest</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon was always a hardworking student. Gerry Warburg, one of his professors, recalls Brogdon sending him a term paper draft about U.S. aid to Africa while traveling home on the team bus from Washington after the ACC title game loss to North Carolina in 2016.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm felt something “really click” inside his basketball consciousness in ninth grade, around the time his parents divorced and the family moved out of 547 Auburn.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, he started training every day after school with his older brother John, and on Sunday mornings before church.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He promised himself nobody in his recruiting class would outwork him, and he still believes that.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>You Might Like <a href=# rel=noopener>Pero Antic Bio: NBA, Net Worth & Family>></a></strong></p><p><span>College Career</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A top 100 recruit, Brogdon chose Virginia over Arkansas, Georgia, and Notre Dame.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After suffering a severe foot injury the previous season, he redshirted his sophomore year. Following that, he was regarded as one of the team’s most important contributors during the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon averaged 5.4 rebounds, 12.7 points, and 2.7 assists per game in 2013–14. He was named a consensus second-team All-American in 2014–15, as well as first-team All-ACC and ACC Co-Defensive Player of the Year.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/malcolm-brogdon--819x1024.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a senior at Virginia in 2015–16, Brogdon was named to the Naismith Trophy’s 35-man midseason watchlist and won numerous prestigious awards.</span></p><p>Moreover, he was named ACC Player of the Year, ACC Defensive Player of the Year, first-team All-American, and a Naismith Award finalist.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon earned a bachelor’s degree in history and a master’s degree in public policy from the University of Virginia. On February 20, 2017, his college jersey number, 15, was retired.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm Brogdon | Age, Height & Weight&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On October 15, 1993, Malcolm Brogdon was born. As a result, he has reached the age of 31 years old.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition, the professional basketball player stands 1.95 m tall and weighs approximately 229 lb.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm learned the toughness required to bulldoze into a lane of NBA big and the craftiness he displays with every fake dribble handoff along the perimeter.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The athlete has lovely dark hair and brown eyes. Moreover, Malcolm is of African-American descent and holds American citizenship.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm was born under the astrological sign of Libra. Sapiens born under the Libra astrological sign are nurturing and caring. They are constantly on the lookout for balance, harmony, and justice.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Professional Career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Milwaukee Bucks picked Brogdon with the 36th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft on June 23, 2016. He signed with the Bucks on July 30, 2016.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He made his NBA debut on October 26, 2016, in the Bucks’ season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording eight points and five assists in 21 minutes.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon made history as the first second-round draft pick to win Rookie of the Year with the Milwaukee Bucks since the common draft era began in 1966.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Two seasons later, he became the eighth player in NBA history to have a 50-40-90 season, indicating a percentage success rate for field goals, three-pointers, and free throws.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/malcolm-brogdon-career.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On October 18, 2017, Brogdon scored 19 points in a 108–100 victory over the Boston Celtics in the Bucks’ season opener. Likewise, he had a season-high ten assists to go with 21 points against the Detroit Pistons on November 3, 2017.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, Malcolm set a season-high with 22 points against the Cleveland Cavaliers four days later. Developed a career-high with 32 points in a 109–105 win over the Phoenix Suns on January 22, 2018.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon won a bronze medal for the United States national team at the 2015 Pan American Games. In 2019, he signed as a free agent with the Pacers.</span></p><h3>Celtics Of Boston (2022–present)</h3><p>Brogdon was traded to the Boston Celtics on July 9, 2022, in exchange for Aaron Nesmith, Daniel Theis, Nik Stauskas, Malik Fitts, Juwan Morgan, and a 2023 first-round draft pick (player).</p><p>Brogdon scored 16 points in a 126-117 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on October 18.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Injury</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon has been nursing an Achilles injury and entered the league’s health and safety protocols after testing positive for COVID-19 in January.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm Brogdon hit a floating jump shot on the Indiana Pacers’ first offensive possession of the game.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, Brogdon ended up with the ball in his hands as the shot clock expired on the next possession. Additionally, he took a hurried shot that only hit the side of the backboard.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If this injury persists past the All-Star break, it would be prudent to have Brogdon sit out the rest of the season. With how the Pacers’ season has gone so far, he has no reason to play hurt.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Injuries have hurt his game, but statistically, Brogdon has been more of a plus for this team than a minus. Hopefully, Brogdon will overcome his injury and return to court sooner rather than later.</span></p><h3>2022 Injury</h3><table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th>DATE</th><th>INJURY</th></tr><tr><td><strong>11/11/22</strong></td><td>Hamstring</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2/28/22</strong></td><td>Rest</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2/24/22</strong></td><td>Achilles</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1/20/22</strong></td><td>Achilles</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Did The Indiana Pacers Ruin Malcolm Brogdon’s Shot?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Certainly not. However,h the Pacers’ request for Malcolm Brogdon to shoot more mid-range shots has undoubtedly impacted Brogdon.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In fact, the crux of his missed 3-pointers is due to the difficulty of his shots rather than the team asking him to do something he is incapable of.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon receives more defensive attention as the Pacers’ focal point than he did as a complementary piece in Milwaukee. Furthermore, only 25% of his 3-point attempts were “wide open,” while only 20% can be classified as such.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon will have to adjust in the future and learn to sink contested and pull-up 3-pointers if he wants to maintain his accuracy.</span></p><p><strong>Don’t Miss Out on <a href=# rel=noopener>Jerrelle Benimon: NBA, Net Worth & More>></a></strong></p><p><span>Comes From A Studious Family</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mitchell Gino Brogdon Sr., Brogdon’s father, is a lawyer and mediator best known as the host of the syndicated court show Personal Injury Court.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon’s mother, Dr. Jann Adams, is the former chairperson of Morehouse College’s Psychology Department. Further, she has been promoted to associate dean of science and mathematics.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unfortunately, his parents divorced when he was 11 years old. Gino, Brogdon’s oldest brother, is a practising attorney, and John, his other older brother, is a law student.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Charity Works&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm Brogdon developed a desire to serve, which has resulted in a seat on the NBPA’s Executive committee and a philanthropic portfolio that spans two continents.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And how Malcolm has found his voice as a social justice activist, carrying on the profound legacies of his neighborhood, family, and name.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He established the Brogdon Family Foundation, with his mother as executive director and two primary programs on the horizon.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/malcolm-brogdon-charity-works-819x1024.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>One example is the John Hurst Adams Education Project, which collaborates on literacy initiatives with seven (and counting) Indianapolis-area schools and plans to take its students on tours of HBCU campuses in spring 2022.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hoops4Humanity, on the other hand, constructs schools in Tanzania and Kenya with infrastructure centered on newly dug freshwater wells.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, it includes indoor handwashing stations and bathrooms and provides students with learning tablets and basketball courts.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jersey No.&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm Brogdon is the Pacers’ No. 7 player. When he enters a new career phase, he changes his numbers.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In high school and his first year at Virginia, he wore 22. However, he switched to 15 after suffering a foot injury and having to sit out a season as a medical redshirt.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The university has retired that number. He changed from 13 to 7 when he joined Milwaukee because it is one of his favorite numbers. Likewise, he also considered the number 11.</span></p><p><span>Malcolm Brogdon Agent Is NBA’s First Female Agent</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Danielle Cantor, the NBA’s first female agent, represents Brogdon. She works with David Falk, a veteran super-agent who has restructured his firm to represent only NBA players.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“As a minority in this country, I think it’s important that you give other people who are overlooked or aren’t given similar opportunities a chance,” Brogdon told the Washington Post.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“I imagined we’d be breaking the glass ceiling and doing something special together.”&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm Brogdon | A Good Person&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Brogdon has a few nice watches. His long-term objectives appear to be modest. He aspires to live a simple life and to be recognized as a good man.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His decision to attend college was motivated by a desire to further his education as well as a desire to play basketball.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, Brogdon seriously considered Notre Dame and Harvard before deciding on Virginia, an elite academic institution.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The game could use more people like Brogdon, a role model for players who can learn not to go broke, not to make bad lifestyle choices, and to see success as more than money.</span></p><h3>2022 Venture</h3><p>Brogdon with his foundation <a href=# rel=noopener>@brogdonfamilyfnd</a> started a new project to spread awareness about the unjustifiable harm caused by America’s broken prison system.</p><p>With their launch of Corrections, a limited-edition collection of wines.&nbsp;</p><p>As he stated in his Instagram post “our efforts align in helping people to see the humanity in one another so that we can lead with compassion.”</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm Brogdon | Girlfriend</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Victoria Janowski is Malcolm Brogdon’s girlfriend in the NBA.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, Janowski was a volleyball player at Virginia University.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Malcolm-Brogdon-1.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She is also the Vice-Chairperson of the Black Student Alliance athletic council at the “University of Virginia.” They were seen hanging out together and posing back to back in a photo.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The couple is very supportive of one another and acts as a pillar of support for one another in order to boost one another’s confidence.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm Brogdon | Net Worth</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Malcolm Brogdon’s net worth has not been officially revealed yet.

Brogdon is now under contract with Indiana for the next four seasons for a total of $89.3 million.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, he has taken an unusual approach through his portfolio: all of the point guard’s financial investments are dedicated to active causes.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They include “impact” companies in the private market and ESG companies in the public market, which consider a company’s environmental, social, and governance practices in addition to traditional financial metrics.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to academic research, the investment returns on these assets are comparable to traditional investing.
