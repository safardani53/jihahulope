Now, it seems, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lionel Messi's name will be on no more FC Barcelona contracts</a>. That's it, it's all over.</p><p>Oh dear.</p><p>Joan Fuster was sitting on a promenade bench a couple of miles from the Nou Camp pitch looking into the Mediterranean sea, for sure he's a Barca fan because he has an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FC Barcelona</a> club badge tattoo covering most of his upper back.</p><p>The man, it's fair to say, is shell shocked.</p><p>He told SunSport: "I feel sick. I just got a text from a mate saying Messi and the club couldn't agree a deal.</p><p>"What? I thought it was done? Yeah, there are financial problems and all that but what a load of bull****.</p><p>"Leo Messi is the best player that has ever lived and he should never wear another club's shirt.

He loves his hair more than the club shirt.</p><p>"I don't know what happens next. It's a mess."</p><h2>'MONEY MONEY MONEY'</h2><p>Meritxell Reus is another fan, sitting in a chiringuito - a beach bar - sipping a small beer with friends and watching the sun go down.</p><p>"Come on, let's get realistic here, eh. Yeah, he's a great player but he's way past his prime," she told SunSport.</p><p>"And I don't buy any of this loyalty crap. It's all about money. Money, money, money.</p><p>"The pot has run dry for Leo Messi but he's been sucking cash out of the club long enough. He should pay back in.</p><p>"Now he'll get a couple of years elsewhere on a load of money.</p><p>"Good riddance, he cost too much anyway.

Pere Munoz tells us, with the TV blaring overhead at a hot dog bar near the beach in Catalan heartland Badalona, "Just watch this space.</p><p>"I don't believe it for a minute.
