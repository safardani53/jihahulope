The miniseries serves as the third installment to Hanks and Spielberg’s acclaimed WWII saga after Band of Brothers and The Pacific.</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Butler’s Elvis performance earned him the 2023 Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture — Drama, along with nominations at the 2023 Academy Awards, BAFTAs and<a href=#> Screen Actors Guild Awards</a>. Butler was awarded in part for his three-year preparation for the role, which included him hoovering donuts and guzzling melted Häagen-Dazs ice cream to quickly gain a bunch of weight to play the older Elvis.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I heard that <strong><a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>,</strong> when he was going to do The Lovely Bones, had microwaved Häagen-Dazs and would drink it. So, I started doing that,” Butler explained during a February episode of the “Variety Awards Circuit” podcast. “I would go get two dozen doughnuts and eat them all. I really started to pack on some pounds. It’s fun for a week or so, and then you feel awful with yourself.”</span><b></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Why-Tom-Hanks-Was-Concerned-for-Austin-Butler-s-Mental-Health-Following-Elvis-264.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Butler prepared so well that he seemed to have trouble letting go of the character — even making headlines <a href=#>for continuing to speak with Elvis’ southern drawl</a> well after he wrapped the movie.

I’m not surprised that it clicks in,” Butler told<a href=#> Elle Australia </a>in June 2022. “Because I’m a shy person, and when I know that there’s bits of Elvis that I’d have to click into in order to go out on stage and be in front of a ton of people, being surrounded by his name everywhere, there’s triggers. You spend so much time obsessing about one thing, and it really is like muscular habits, your mouth can change.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuopV2drq%2B30maumqtdmLyvr8SrpZ6cXZu8s3nArqqtoZ5ir7bAy56prGWdmru1rctmn56ZnKm1bq3FrZyrZZWhw6q%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
