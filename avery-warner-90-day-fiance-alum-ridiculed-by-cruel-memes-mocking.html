(Seriously, some 90 Day Fiance fans insisted that they were being pranked with another woman’s face)
But several cruel memes have looked past Avery’s lip fillers to mock and body-shame her … more intimate features.
As fans get mean about her labia, even people who don’t care for Avery are speaking out in her defense."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Kalani asked incredulously.</p><p>That is a very fair question.</p><p>Avery also allegedly took to DMs to call out the blogger whom she seems to blame for distributing the leaked OnlyFans image.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There, she threatened legal action — and it looks like she is continuing to blame this particular blogger.</p><p>It should be noted that distributing OnlyFans photos without permission is not permitted by T&S of the site and also seems illegal.</p><p>Avery cannot do anything about the memes, but those distributing photos without permission may be in trouble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Instagram user @mommy_says_bad_words, however, has strongly denied that she is the distributor.</p><p>She notes that the photo has been in broad circulation for weeks, easily found via a simple internet search — and she’s right about that.</p><p>As useful as the internet can be for so many things, it can also make it so that stolen intellectual property is impossible to put back under wraps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Still, this whole thing is a shame. If fans don’t like Avery, that is more than fair, considering who she has chosen to be as a person.</p><p>There are plenty of perfectly valid criticisms to levy against him.</p><p>The appalling, evil bulls–t that she spews freely online is damning all by itself and hardly needs commentary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But Avery’s racism, her apparent QAnon leanings, and her love for disgraced former president Donald Trump are right there.</p><p>So why are people taking aim at her (perfectly normal) genitals with cruel memes?</p><p>At times, it seems like some people don’t ever stop to think about the memes that they share.
