His previous bands include The Refreshments and the Mortals. Clyne and the Peacemakers (also known as RCPM) released their eighth full-length studio album, "Native Heart", on June 30th, 2017. His musical career has spanned over two decades, including several hits with The Refreshments and penning the theme song for the animated television series King of the Hill. He wrote and recorded the victory song for his hometown Major League Baseball club, the Arizona Diamondbacks, entitled The D-Backs Swing.Much of Clyne's music throughout his career revolves around life in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. He was born in Tucson and grew up in Tempe where he balanced life as a suburban kid while visiting his grandparents' ranch in southern Arizona, where, he rode horses, herded cattle and fixed fences. As a youth and young adult, his frequent trips south of the border to Mexico have influenced his music. Clyne attended college at Arizona State University, where he played with several bands.While at ASU, he did a Spanish immersion class and lived with a family in Enseñada, Mexico. During that same stay, he also did an ethnography for Anthropology credit of his choice of subject, Mariachis. This meant Clyne would follow them around town and interview them while buying them beers and gaining their trust.Every album since then that Clyne has written for both The Refreshments and RCPM have had mariachi horns on them. His love of a beach town on the Sea of Cortez in Sonora, Mexico called Puerto Peñasco (Rocky Point) came through when he decided to have his band play there for a concert in 2000. What started as a one night, one band concert there, grew into what is now a 4 day annual music festival named, Circus Mexicus. The event brings over 5,000 people and two events, the Hot Dog & a Smile and the Rock & Beach Soccer tournament both raise money for charities based in Rocky Point.Clyne owns his own tour bus and tours all over the United States every year. His other interests include his own brand of ultra premium tequila, named Roger Clyne's Mexican Moonshine Tequila.He also is part owner of a bar in Puerto Peñasco called Banditos. Clyne and his wife, Alisa Nicole Clyne, live in Tempe; they have three children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbHAomWcp51ks6K5xGignZ2eqba1tcSsZqunl5q%2Fbq%2FLsqWe</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
