Beyoncé launched her BeyGood nonprofit in 2013 to foster a society “where everyone has an opportunity to prosper.” The organization recently launched a $1 million initiative to help businesses and communities impacted by economic inequities at the Black Parade Route Small Business Impact Luncheon. Then, in both Chicago and Atlanta, BeyGood awarded small business owners $10,000 in grants to further build their enterprises."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Kelce, who was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2013, started 87 & Running two years later. Per the nonprofit’s website, it is designed to empower “disadvantaged youth to achieve success by providing resources and support” in their local communities and “cultivating their talent in the areas of education, business athletics, STEM and the arts.”</p><p class=p1>Due to Kelce’s generosity, 87 & Running (named after his NFL jersey number) has allowed more than 2,300 children to have greater access to remote learning support, after-school enrichment, tutoring and inspirational speakers.</p><p class=p1>Kelce, 34, likely bonded with his girlfriend, <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, over giving back, as the pop star uses her own big reputation to help communities in need. (Kelce and Swift, 34, <a href=#>have been dating since summer</a> 2023.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Celebrities-Who-Give-Back-All-Year-Long-Beyonce-Travis-Kelce-and-More-Who-Help-Those-in-Need-514.jpg><p class=p1>After deadly tornadoes ripped across Tennessee in December, Swift <a href=#>reportedly donated $1 million</a> to the Tennessee Emergency Response Fund. (Swift <a href=#>has called Nashville home</a> since she was a teenager breaking into the music industry.)</p><p class=p1>Additionally, Swift has made sure to support those in need while performing at<a href=#> her <i>Eras Tour </i>concerts</a>, which began in March. She has donated to local food banks, including the Second Harvest of Silicon Valley Food Bank. Second Harvest noted that Swift’s aid helped “to nourish an average of about 500,000 people every month” in California’s Santa Clara and San Mateo counties.</p><p class=p1>Beyoncé, Kelce and Swift are not the only stars known to help others. <strong>Meryl Streep</strong> and <strong>George Clooney</strong> were instrumental in helping out-of-work actors during the SAG-AFTRA strike earlier this year. (The labor union voted to go on strike in July after contract negotiations stalled with film studios. They <a href=#>ultimately reached a compromise</a> in November.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Streep, 74, and Clooney, 62, joined forces to lead a donation campaign, and each of them contributed $1 million of their own money to the cause. Their efforts ultimately raised more than $15 million for SAG-AFTRA’s Emergency Financial Assistance Program thanks to generous donations made by fellow A-listers <strong>Matt Damon</strong> and <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>.</p><p class=p1>For more on how stars from <strong>Harry Styles</strong> and <strong>Jason Momoa</strong> to <strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong> give back, watch the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacnZyar7O106KcrGWnnbxus8CvnGaakZi4bq3LpWSynZGneq27zaBkm52ppLuksYyapZ1lnaS%2Fpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
