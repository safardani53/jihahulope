Second comes his light snack, including fruits and protein smoothies.</p><p>Following it is his lunch, which consists of chicken breast or fish, rice, salads, loads of veggies.</p><p>Then, it is again time for a light snack where he munches fruits and almonds. Finally, it’s time for dinner.</p><p>Usman’s dinner is a bit similar to lunch with some chicken breast or fish, salad with mayo, and of course, veggies.</p><h2>Kamaru Usman | Childhood & Education</h2><p>Kamaru Usman was born into a Nigerian family on May 11, 1987, under the Taurus’ sun sign.</p><p>Back then, his father was a Nigerian army while his mother was a teacher. Indeed, everyone has their share of back story in their childhood days, so did Usman.</p><p>Usman was born in the black ethnicity as he grew and was raised in a small town at Auchi, Edo state, alongside his two brothers, Kashetu Usman and Mohammed Usman.</p><p>They were a middle-class family and used to walk miles for water. As he spent eight years of his life in such conditions, his father bought them in the US.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Usman-and-his-brothers-with-their-father.jpg><p>As they immigrated to the US, it wasn’t a pleasant journey following it. Usman was a black child with a poor command of English and was often teased in school.</p><p>During his tenure in Bowie High School in Arlington, Texas, he encountered stuff, but he was never the one to give up.</p><p>As said, he was poor in English; thus, Usman attended ESL classes, which helped him master the language.</p><p>All in all, as he recalls the day, he only has a smile on his face. Usman does agree that his former days shaped him to be what he is today.</p><p>“Growing up, you don’t really realize what this is doing for you and how this is molding you until I got to the point now. I’m able to look back, and I’m like, ‘wow.’ I think so differently because of these experiences.”<br>-Kamaru Usman</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>During his high school tenure, Usman wasn’t quite the big guy.</p><p>After getting well with the American culture, Usman joined the football team during his sophomore year.</p><p>That was when he was suggested to try wrestling and get into it; however, Usman had declined.</p><p>Eventually, when he got a big injury during a football match, Usman tried to wrestle.</p><p>Little did he know, the girl he first faced was a three-time state champion, and thus, Usman was dominated so badly.</p><p>Although a girl had toppled him, Usman did not flinch but was more driven towards it.</p><p>When he graduated high school, Usman had an impressive record of 53-3 in football and enrolled in the University of Nebraska at Kearny.</p><h3>Wrestling</h3><p>Nearing the end of high school, Usman started wrestling and gained the nickname “Marty,” as his coach couldn’t pronounce his name Kamarudeen.</p><p>During the tenure, Usman tried his hands-on wrestling for a year in Iowa&nbsp;at&nbsp;William Penn University.</p><p>As per the source, Usman left Penn University due to an inevitable reason.</p><p>When Usman was an NAIA national tournament qualifier, he couldn’t attend the event due to a snowstorm; however, the coach and the team left for the event without him.</p><p>Thus, he later transferred to the University of Nebraska at Kearney (UNK).</p><p>During his tenure in UNK, Usman bagged NCAA&nbsp;Division II&nbsp;All-American honors three times and became a two-time national finalist.</p><p>Furthermore, Usman wrestled in the world team member for the freestyle wrestling in 2010. Right after it, former&nbsp;National Football League&nbsp;(NFL) star&nbsp;Christian Okoye (nicknamed The Nigerian Nightmare) gave Usman to use his nickname.</p><h2>Kamaru Usman | Mixed Martial Arts Career</h2><p>The MMA came into Usman’s life just as the wrestling did; he blew it up without knowing.</p><p>However, in the end, Usman was training for the 2012 Olympic trials, and during those periods, he met former UFC light heavyweight champion, Rashad Evans.</p><p>Later, with the endorsement of Evans, Usman commenced MMA and won his foremost professional fight in 2012 at RFA 5 in Nebraska.</p><p>Following it was then his foremost loss six months later.</p><h3>The Ultimate Fighter</h3><p>As Usman entered the UFc as Rashad Evans’ team, he appeared on The Ultimate Fighter 21.</p><p>Later, Usman faced Michael Graves and claimed his first fight through a majority decision.</p><p>As the event continued, Usman bagged the victory towards the end.</p><p>He claimed the match with a unanimous decision against&nbsp;former&nbsp;WSOF Welterweight Champion&nbsp;Steve Carl during the semifinals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Ultimate-Fight-21.jpg><p>Eventually, in the finals, Usman pinned down Hayder Hassan via submission in the second round.</p><p>Therefore, his performance gained him the Night bonus’s Performance alongside a six-figure contract with the UFC.</p><h3>Ultimate Fighting Championship</h3><p>With a successful entry into the UFC came a successful debut for it. On December 19, 2015, at UFC on Fox 17, Usman defeated Leon Edwards through a unanimous decision.</p><p>Throughout his journey in the UFC, Usman had a streak of victories all along the way.</p><p>First, Usman defeated Alexander Yakovlev at UFC on Fox 20 (unanimous decision); secondly, he took over Warlley Alves at UFC Fight Night 100 (unanimous decision).</p><p>Then, he bagged the victory against&nbsp;Sean Strickland at&nbsp;UFC 210 (unanimous decision).</p><p>Following it, he won&nbsp;UFC Fight Night 116 against Sérgio Moraes (knockout in the first round).</p><p>Afterward, Usman pinned&nbsp;Emil Weber Meek at UFC Fight Night 124 (unanimous decision).</p><p>Later, Usman toppled down Demian Maia at&nbsp;UFC Fight Night 129 (unanimous decision).</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;at&nbsp;The Ultimate Fighter 28 Finale, Usman faced Rafael dos Anjos winning him by unanimous decision, which gained him the Performance of the Night award.</p><h4><span id=UFC_Welterweight_Champion class=mw-headline>UFC Welterweight Champion</span></h4><p>With a series of fights, Usman had his eyes always in a fixed direction.</p><p>After defeating many, he was finally seen as a possible threat to Tyron Woodley’s impressive reign.</p><p>“I’m looking at him like, ‘I’ma get at you one day. There’s no disrespect. That’s my man. We’re cool. But, you got what I want, and I don’t care what face is attached to it.'”<br>-Kamaru Usman</p><p>Eventually, Usman faced UFC Welterweight Champion Tyron Woodley in the co-main event at UFC 235.</p><p>Thus, Usman grounded his way to the top defeating Woodley via unanimous decision after dominating five rounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Nigerian-Nightmare.jpg><p>Advancing further, Usman appeared against his long-time rival Colby Covington at UFC 245. There is a different story to the fight that we shall mention in the latter sections of the article.</p><p>Their fight included loads of strikes instead of grapples claimed by Usman through a technical knockout in the fifth round.</p><p>Overall, both were awarded Fight of The Night awards for their performances.</p><p>In the forthcoming fight, Usman trained hugely under Trevor Wittman to face <a href=# rel=noopener>Gilbert Burns</a>&nbsp;at UFC 251.</p><p>However, nearing the date of the fight, Burns was tested positive for the COVID-19 test.</p><p>Hence, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jorge Masvidal</a> came forward for the game, which Usman won through a unanimous decision.</p><p>Altogether, the fight was titled to have the most pay-per-view bought in the United States with1.3 million after the one in October 2018.</p><h4>Recent News</h4><p>As of December 12, 2020, at UFC 256, Usman was scheduled to face <a href=# rel=noopener>Gilbert Burns</a>.</p><p>However, Usman is reported to have been going through an injury treatment.</p><p>Therewith, the match has been rescheduled for February 13, 2021, at UFC 258.</p><h2>Kamaru Usman | MMA Achievements and Records</h2><p>Usman is a wrestler who fights with opponents dominating through one-sided decision wins.</p><p>Therefore, he had been named as the boring fighter and fought to see by some critics.</p><p>However, Usman had a sassy remark as a clap back.</p><p>“There was a time when people started hating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Mayweather</a>‘s dominant fight, although he was good at what he does. Why? Because people want to see a bar fight? We’re risking our lives in here, and we are not up there to take punches. You train to be able to make someone miss, to control someone in a certain way. That’s what training is for, so you’re not just going in there and taking punishment at will. I do that better than anybody.”<br>-Kamaru Usman</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/UFC-Welterweight-Champion.jpg><ul><li>National Collegiate Athletic Association<ul><li>NCAA Division II Wrestling Championship (2010)</li><li>NCAA Division II Wrestling All-American (2008, 2009 & 2010)</li></ul></li><li>Ultimate Fighting Championship<ul><li>UFC Welterweight Championship&nbsp;(One time, current)</li><li>First-ever Nigerian-born champion in UFC history</li><li>The Ultimate Fighter 21 tournament winner</li><li>Performance of the Night (Two times)&nbsp;</li><li>Fight of the Night (One time)&nbsp;</li><li>Latest finish in UFC Welterweight&nbsp;history</li><li>Tied for&nbsp;most consecutive wins in the welterweight division</li><li>2019 December Fight of the Month (by MMAJunkie.com)</li></ul></li></ul><table width=637><tbody><tr><td rowspan=2 width=143>Total games</td><td colspan=3 width=257>Wins (17)</td><td rowspan=2 width=237>Loss</td></tr><tr><td width=81>Knockout</td><td width=95>Submission</td><td width=81>Decision</td></tr><tr><td width=143>18</td><td width=81>7</td><td width=95>1</td><td width=81>9</td><td width=237>1 (by submission)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Recent Updates</h2><h3>Kumaru Usman, Happy with <a href=#>Israel Adesanya</a>’s victory</h3><p>&nbsp;UFC welterweight champion, Kumaru Usman is quite happy and satisfied with <a href=#>Israel Adesanya</a>‘s win over Marvin Vettori.</p><p>Moreover, he adds on saying, <a href=#>Israel Adesanya</a>’s win shows the superiority of Nigerian fighters.&nbsp;</p><p>Adesanya grabbed over the middleweight title by knocking out Vettori via unanimous decision.</p><p>Claiming Adesanya as his brother, Kumaru was feeling content to be a Nigerian and was amazed how he took over the bout.
