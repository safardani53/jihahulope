His parents are Tito Horford and Arelis Reynoso, and he is the oldest of five kids.</p><p>Tito is a former NBA player drafted in the 1988 NBA Draft’s second round as the 39th pick by the Milwaukee Bucks. Hence, it is safe to think that the father influenced his oldest son career-wise.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, he was the first Dominican-born player to play in the league. Likewise, Tito served as a center to the Bucks from 1988 to 1990.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, he had a brief career with the Washington Bullets, now known as Washington Wizards. Following that, the center went on to play in France and Italy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Al-Horford-Father.jpg><p>At the same time, the former basketballer was also playing for the Dominican National team and in the Dominican semi-pro leagues. Before his professional career, he played collegiate basketball for the University of Miami.</p><p>He had an outstanding career with the Miami Hurricanes men’s basketball team. Not to mention, his school, Marian Christian High School, recruited him from the Dominican Republic.&nbsp;</p><p>As a kid, Al used to follow his father around during his practices and games and became heavily attached to basketball shortly after.

She listened to her son when he wanted to attend a basketball academy at six years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Arelis even convinced the academy to make an exception for Al since the academy only enrolled seven years old and above kids. She always believed in his dream and did everything possible to ensure he could achieve it.&nbsp;</p><p>Reynoso started scavenging for the best basketball programs for her only son when he was in middle school. She knew that it was essential for Al to attend high school in the United States to improve his skills even more.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, after a good talk with her ex-husband and his wife, they decided that Al would move to the US after finishing middle school.</p><p>As much as she wanted to be there with her kid, Reynoso knew that moving to the US would be substantial for her son’s basketball career.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learn More About Celtics’ Former Power Forward, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dwight Powell Bio: Net Worth, Achilles, Contract & Girlfriend >></a></strong></p><h3>Siblings</h3><p>Tito’s love for basketball did not just rub on Al but all of his kids.
