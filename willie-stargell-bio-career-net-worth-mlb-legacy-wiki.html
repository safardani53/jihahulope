However, nothing happened even after Willie ignored it.</p><h3>Willie Stargell: Professional career</h3><p>Willie had earned a lot of admirers in Pittsburgh by his charisma and playing style. People began to recognize him by the name “Willie.” However, he preferred his original name, <strong>“Wilver.”</strong></p><h4>Style of play</h4><p>Willie looked bigger than other batters because of his height, long arms, and unique way of holding the bat. He used to hold only the knob of the bat, which provided extra bat extension for home run swings.</p><p>Willie would be seen warming up with a sledgehammer in the on-deck circle. He would swerve his bat until the pitcher threw the ball.</p><h4>Debut and early days</h4><p>1962 was Willie’s debut season in Major League Baseball. But the success came to him after some seasons. He started as the Pirates’ regular left-fielder.</p><p>The home run at Shea Stadium in April 1964 was his first.

It made him the only player to win all three MVP honors in the same season.</p><h4>Final Days</h4><p>After having the best season in 1979, Willie’s MLB career was on the verge of its end. After 74 games in 1979, he retired. With a total of 475 home runs, Stargell hit 310 of those in his thirties.</p><h4>Long home runs</h4><p>During his career, Willie made many records for the longest home runs in many of the NL parks. The longest at Dodger Stadium as his 507 feet home run in 1969.</p><p>He hit the longest of 535 feet in Veterans Stadium history in 1971.
