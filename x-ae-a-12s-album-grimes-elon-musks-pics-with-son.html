He went on to share photos of the newborn as well as the infant’s name.</p><p>Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher, <a href=#>explained the inspiration behind the unique moniker</a> later that same week. “X, the unknown variable,” the Canadian star tweeted at the time. “Æ, my elven spelling of Ai (love &/or Artificial intelligence). A-12 = precursor to SR-17 (our favorite aircraft). No weapons, no defenses, just speed. Great in battle, but non-violent + (A = Archangel, my favorite song) (metal rat).”</p><p>She went on to write, “I think it sounds like the name of the main character in the story. I hope he vibes with that. OK, going back into the pain/ beauty reverie for [some] time, just came on to add my thoughts. Peace to all.”</p><p>When <a href=#>Musk corrected</a> the “My Name Is Dark” singer, writing, “SR-71, but yes,” she replied, “I am recovering from surgery and barely alive so may my typos b [sic] forgiven but, damnit. That was meant to be profound.”</p><p>The tech entrepreneur previously welcomed five children with his ex-wife <strong>Justine Musk</strong> — twins Xavier and Griffin and triplets Damian, Kai and Saxon — but X AE A-XII is Grimes’ first child.</p><p>The “Oblivion” singer <a href=#>announced in January that she was expecting</a> by posting a topless baby bump photo. “I thought about censoring [my nipples] for a hot minute haha (this may get taken down anyway) but the photo is so much less feral without the nipples. Plus being knocked up is a very feral & war-like state of being,” she captioned the social media upload at the time. “Might as well be what it is. Plus most of my friends told me not to post them so then I was afflicted with reverse psychology. Interrogated my shame on it and decided it was sum weird internalized self-hatred to feel uncomfortable abt my body. Hope ur having a nice day!”</p><p>The pair made their relationship red-carpet official in 2018. “<a href=#>Elon and Grimes have experienced a lot of ups and downs</a> in their relationship throughout Grimes’ pregnancy and have been on and off,” a source told Us Weekly exclusively of their relationship following X AE A-XII’s birth. “Through it all though, they have and will continue to maintain a close friendship.”</p><p>More than one year after welcoming their son, Musk announced that <a href=#>he and Grimes were “semi-separated.”</a> He told Page Six in September 2021, “[We] still love each other, see each other frequently and are on great terms.”</p><p>In March 2022, the songwriter revealed that the pair had <a href=#>welcomed their second child together via surrogate</a> three months prior.</p><p>“I don’t know what I was thinking,” Grimes told Vanity Fair about not sharing <a href=#>the news of daughter Exa Dark Sideræl’s birth</a>. “Whatever is going on with family stuff, I just feel like kids need to stay out of it, and X is just out there. I mean, I think E is really seeing him as a protégé and bringing him to everything and stuff.… X is out there. His situation is like that. But, yeah, I don’t know.”</p><p>The Canada native also <a href=#>offered an update on her relationship status with Musk</a>, saying, “There’s no real word for it. I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we’re very fluid. We live in separate houses. We’re best friends. We see each other all the time. … We just have our own thing going on, and I don’t expect other people to understand it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later that same day, Grimes clarified on social media that<a href=#> the twosome had parted ways since the interview.</a></p><p>Keep scrolling to see photos of Grimes and Elon’s baby boy, from hospital shots to cute cuddles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkxW6txGaYZmliqHqiuMGupGafop66pr%2BMnqOopl2iwrS30manopujYsSqwMdmqqimXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
