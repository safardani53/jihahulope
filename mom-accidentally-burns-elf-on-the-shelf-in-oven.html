That was the beginning of the end for poor Elfis. Later, Mease went to bake some pasta.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I seriously forgot I put the freaking elf in the freaking oven,” Mease shared. “I preheated the oven and started cleaning the kitchen. About 4 minutes later I started to smell something REALLY funky and that’s when all hell broke loose.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mease’s son Gray wandered into the kitchen at the very moment Mease and her friend Brittany were using “kitchen utensils to get our burnt and melting elf” out of the oven.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I would have that that with Gray being older he would have laughed at it but it was IIy that laughed and Gray that got his little heart broken,” Mease lamented in her post. “I seriously suck.” But she’s working on making it up to him.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Sooo . . . guess what I’m doing today? I’m having to scramble and find the other elf we have and then I have to call Santa (in front of the kids) and ask him if he will please pick up Elfis tonight,” she wrote. “Ya know, since he is unable to make it to the North Pole tog et fixed because his head literally popped off from being too hot once we pulled him out of the oven and his feet completely melted off.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Mease’s hilarious story has been shared more than 113,000 times and received 57,000 comments.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamp51irqSvyJ2cp6yRobm6ecGuqaerXZq5p3nOp2StoJViwKmxy59koqZdpMOmuo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
