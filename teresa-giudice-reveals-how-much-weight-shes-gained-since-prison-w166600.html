The <i>Real Housewives of New Jersey</i> star opened up exclusively with<i> Us Weekly</i> about her new body and more on Saturday, March 5.</p><p>“I’ve gained a little over 5 pounds since I’ve been home,” Giudice, 43, told <i>Us</i> at her meet-and-greet event at Mont Airy Casino and Resort in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. “Joe’s a booty guy, so he likes it too. He’s been saying the same thing that my booty has grown and he likes it.”</p><p>“He’s been all over me since I got home,” she added. “Joe wants to be together and cuddle all the time.”</p><p>The <i>Turning the Tables </i>author was <a href=#>released after 11 months behind bars</a> at the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut in December. Since then, the couple have been spending as much time together as possible before Joe, also 43, <a href=#>begins his 41-month sentence</a> at Fort Dix FCI in New Jersey for fraud changes this month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/teresa-giudice-joe-zoom-e3f86b59-9c1d-469b-800b-bbc208bdec9f.jpg><p>According to Teresa, Joe “hasn’t even asked” for advice, however. “I didn’t know anything [when I went to prison]. You go with the flow,” she explained. “You just go with it and you adapt. You don’t trust anyone.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Teresa is obviously not keen on Joe leaving, but she plans to keep busy while he’s away. Besides taking care of their four daughters — Gia, 15, Gabriella, 11, Milania, 10, and Audriana, 6 — the cookbook scribe also will focus on her new yoga instructor certification.</p><p>“I just love it so much and I just want to learn everything about it. I’d eventually like to come out with my own yoga DVD and a yoga clothing line and maybe open my own yoga studio,” she revealed to <i>Us</i>. “I just love yoga, it’s good for my body and more importantly, it’s good for my mind.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnaKawKJ5xqKsnaGTmnqzsdWemKWrXZ28uHnMrpqhZaeatqi002aqoZ2jYrSitc2em2armaOwpnnPq6Csp55ixHKClW9naWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
