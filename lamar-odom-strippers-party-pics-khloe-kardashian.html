The former Lakers player chatted with his friends while receiving neck and shoulder massages from some of strippers. Cause, ya, that’s how Lamar rolls. He and a buddy were later seen leaving the club accompanied by two women.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CLICK HERE TO SEE PICS OF LAMAR SURROUNDED BY STRIPPERS.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The raunchy images have appeared just days after Lamar’s ex-wife, <strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong>, 32, discussed her fears for his life, on the Aug. 21 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.&nbsp;Khloe said “there is only one outcome” for Lamar, who has taken “five steps backwards” in his recovery after he almost died of an&nbsp;overdose of drugs and alcohol in October 2015. After that he was in a coma, then needed dialysis and physical therapy so he could learn to walk and talk again.</p><h3><a class=pmclinkcontent-post href=# rel=noopener>Khloe Kardashian & Lamar Odom: Their Sweetest Moments Together</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Khloe told <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>, 35,&nbsp;and <strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong>, 37, that she can’t get Lamar’s recovery back on track because he is not following through with his therapy. And she’s right, as on Aug. 21 he was seen in Rhode Island smoking what appeared to be marijuana. “You can’t do anything if the person is not willing to take control of their life and get help. It was like five steps backwards. I don’t even know what to do and I told him, ‘You know you could die right now.'” We’re really hoping Lamar is able to get his life, and recovery, back on track soon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Lamar will be able to get it together?
