As he told PEOPLE, “That's what balances my life out. Family is the most important thing, because the curtain will come down eventually, and then what do you have?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here is everything to know about Donny Osmond’s five children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-donald-clark-osmond-jr-44></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Donald Clark Osmond Jr., 44</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Mazur/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Donny and Debbie welcomed their first son together, Donald Clark Osmond Jr., on July 31, 1979. As Donny Jr. has shared, he was born after his father’s heyday as a teen idol and, as a result, missed out on the more intense phases of his dad's career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I actually never saw the height of it all, like the crazed fans throwing themselves against the stage," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told The Spectrum</a> in 2016. Donny's TV variety show&nbsp;Donny & Marie, in which he starred alongside his sister, ended six months before Donny Jr. was born.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2022, Donny Jr. told PEOPLE that family means everything to his dad.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My father puts his family first, and he has unique ways of expressing it — like his orchard where each tree is dedicated to each one of his grandchildren," he said. "Next to entertaining, my father's greatest gift is to show love, and he does that in a big way.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As an adult, Donny Jr. runs his own marketing firm, OzComm, though he’s moved into business marketing instead of entertainment.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Donny Jr. married his wife Jessica in 2010, and the two have four children together.

In 2001, Donny <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up to The Guardian</a> about his relationship with Jeremy and revealed that his second child went through a bit of a rebellious phase as a teen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the outlet, in addition to reportedly piercing his tongue and eyebrow, Jeremy dyed his hair with leopard spots, left the Mormon faith and church he was raised in and did not speak to his family for four years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think a lot of the rebellion came from the fact that he was my son — you know, this whole Osmond thing. He couldn't stand the whole Osmond image," Donny said. "When you are forced to be a certain thing, that's why you want to rebel: 'I don't want to be pigeonholed, I don't want to be just another Mormon Osmond,' you know.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jeremy later reconnected with his family and even went on a mission to Italy in 2001. He married Melisa Osmond the following year, and the two <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>have three children</a> together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>his LinkedIn profile</a>, Jeremy is a physical therapist who previously owned his own practice.

As an adult, Brandon is part of a design agency in Provo, Utah, and also owns his own company. Like his father, Brandon has a passion for music and performing, though, in a 2022 interview with Salt Lake City’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Fox13</a>, he clarified that he mostly does so just for fun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brandon also spoke about the unique experience of growing up with a famous figure as a father. "There was one moment in my life where Donny Osmond and my dad crossed paths in my house. And it was really hard for me, because I had separated the two," he told the outlet, recalling witnessing a call his dad received shortly after his grandfather, George Osmond, died in 2007.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So he picks up the phone. And I hear this sweet high pitched voice. 'Hey, Donny, I just wanted to call and just tell you, I'm sorry about your dad.' And they have this conversation for maybe two or three minutes," Brandon told Fox13. "He finishes it with 'Thanks, Michael. That means a lot to me.' And I realized that the King of Pop, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michael Jackson</a>, just called my dad, my dad didn't call him."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "And it was really weird for me because they clashed. Donny Osmond and my dad were now the same person, and it really wrecked me. It really was a hard thing for me to see.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brandon married his wife Shelby in 2008, and the pair have four sons.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-christopher-glenn-osmond-33></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Christopher Glenn Osmond, 33</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Donny Osmond Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chris Osmond was born in Irvine, California, on Dec. 12, 1990. Chris expressed an interest in music and performing from an early age, largely inspired by his father’s career and success around the world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>website</a>, he took piano lessons as a child and DJ'd as a teen. He later studied post-production audio engineering in college before taking a job at Disney in Burbank, California.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2022 interview with Fox13, Chris spoke about what it was like to be a part of a famous family, saying, "For us, we’re very fortunate to have that name. And to have an influence in this world for good. But ... we still have to be super creative."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chris later appeared in season two of Claim to Fame, where he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stumped contestants</a> as they tried to guess his celebrity relative. Chris told PEOPLE that his dad was "laughing through" all the wrong guesses, which included everyone from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Elvis Presley</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Elton John</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2023, Donny told PEOPLE that he thinks the clear <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>generational gap</a> played to the show's advantage. "I think he's making the show interesting because they [couldn’t] figure out who he is,” the legendary singer said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This dynamic of having Chris on the show, that's what's making it exciting because the older generation, they know exactly what it is," Donny added. "And the younger kids, they have no idea."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for his own music career, Chris has released three singles. He currently lives in Utah with his wife Alta, whom he wed in 2017. The couple welcomed their daughter, Aussie, in December 2020, and their son, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dune</a>, in June 2023.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-joshua-davis-osmond-25></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Joshua Davis Osmond, 25</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Donny Osmond Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Donny and Debbie's fifth son Joshua was born on Feb. 16, 1998.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, Donny <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shared on Instagram</a> that Joshua had spent the previous two years serving as a missionary for the Church of Latter-day Saints in Rome, Italy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“A wonderful reunion in Rome! 🇮🇹 After two years of valiantly serving as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Italy, our son Josh will return home with us for a reunion with the entire family," he wrote. "What a birthday! What a Christmas.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over two years later, Josh married his wife Summer.
