He also spent two seasons with the Houston Gamblers of the United States Football League. Kelly played college football at Miami, where he was the Offensive MVP of the 1981 Peach Bowl. One of the six quarterbacks taken in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft, Kelly was selected 14th overall by the Bills. He chose to sign with the Gamblers instead and did not play for the Bills until the USFL folded in 1986. Employing the "K-Gun" offense, known for its no-huddle shotgun formations, Kelly led one of the greatest NFL scoring juggernauts. From 1990 to 1993, he helped guide the Bills to a record four consecutive Super Bowls, although the team lost each game. Kelly was also named to five Pro Bowls and received first-team All-Pro honors in 1991.</p><table class=wikibox readability=1><tr><td class=wk_label>Position</td><td class=wk_value>Quarterback</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Date of birth</td><td class=wk_value>February 14, 1960</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Place of birth</td><td class=wk_value>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>High school</td><td class=wk_value>East Brady (PA)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>College</td><td class=wk_value>Miami (FL)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>NFL Draft</td><td class=wk_value>1983 / Round: 1/ Pick: 14</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Official Website</td><td class=wk_value>http://www.jimkelly.com</td></tr></table><p>Movie Actor Jim Kelly was born in Kentucky, United States on May 5, 1946.
