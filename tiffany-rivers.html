After high school graduation, Rivers went to North Carolina State University in 2000.</p><h2>Age & Body Measurements</h2><p>The love of Philip Rivers, Tiffany, was born in the year 1982, making her 41&nbsp;years old as of 2023.</p><p>Based on her birthdate Tiffany’s zodiac sign is Scorpio, and people of this sign are known to be mysterious, charming, and sensual at the same time.</p><p>Despite being in her 40s, Rivers is vibrant and youthful as ever. Her short black hair suits her dark eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>She stands at 1.70 meters and weighs around 149 lb; however, her other body measurements are unavailable. Rivers has not disclosed this personal information to the public yet.</p><h2>Tiffany Rivers Has Her Swimwear Line</h2><p>Being a nine-children mother is no easy task, yet Tiffany has balanced her professional and personal life like a pro. Indeed, looking after nine children helped her a lot through the process.</p><p>Similarly, Tiffany brought elegance and taste to her swimwear line Hermoza. Co-founded with Marisa DeLecce, a San Diego-based fashion maven, their lines are modest but fashionable at the same time.</p><p>The designs show comfort and style, which are lacking in swimwear. Likewise, the company’s name, Hermoza, is derived from the Spanish word Hermosa meaning beautiful.</p><p>Also, the collection infuses Latin-influenced prints with vibrant colors, bold designs, and chic-sophisticated elegance. The classic Spanish design that reflects the feminine charm is a favorite of many.</p><h2>Tiffany & Philip Rivers’s Relationship</h2><p>They say one glance is all it takes to know your soulmate. Though we have no idea how much truth it holds, seeing Philip and Tiffany, it might be right. Both were born and raised in Alabama and grew close together.</p><p>But their love blossomed in middle school, and the two started dating.</p><p>Philip even recalled a sweet moment when he was a boy and spotted Tiffany at a ball game. The young player pointed at her and said to his mother, “See her? That’s a good girl.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Philip-Rivers-2.jpg><p>He even admitted to telling Tiffany she was the one for him. After their high school graduation, Philip enrolled in North Carolina State University in 2000, and Tiffany followed him soon after.</p><p>Regardless of what others say, it is still surprising that these two have been together for more than 22 years. Fragile is something not appropriate to describe their relationship.</p><p>After dating for five years, Philip claimed they remained chaste and took their relationship to the next level. Rivers was just a freshman at NC State, but he was sure of Tiffany.</p><p>Soon, Philip asked for approval from both his and Tiffany’s parents and planned a proposal. Of course, the player also requested permission from his coach, Chuck Amato.</p><p>After getting everyone’s approval, Philip popped the question, which Tiffany gladly accepted. And finally, in the spring of 2001, the two were pronounced husband and wife.</p><p>Just at the tender age of 19 and 18, the two lovebirds began their new life.</p><h2>The Rivers’ Proud Parents Of Nine Children</h2><p>Not only did they marry while still in their teens, but Tiffany also became a mother before she turned 20.</p><p>The couple was still in college when they welcomed their first child, a daughter named Halle, on July 6, 2002; as of 2023, she is 21.</p><p>Being a father might have scared other boys his age, but according to coach Chuck, Philip matured even more after being a father.</p><p>Similarly, the two had another child, a daughter named Grace, in 2003. After two years, Tiffany became pregnant again and gave birth to their son, Gunner.</p><p>Though other parents would have stopped having kids at this point, Tiffany and Philip were far from it. Again on January 31, 2010, they had Sarah Catherine followed by Peter in 2011.</p><p>Moreover, in 2013, Rebecca was born, followed by Clare in 2015. She again became pregnant with Anna Rivers in 2018.</p><p>During a 7-on-7 event in Daphne in July 2023, Philip revealed that he and his wife, Tiffany, are <a href=#>expecting their 10th child, a baby boy</a>, in October.</p><p>This delightful news arrived amidst the Rivers’ already bustling household, where their nine children, ranging in age from 4 to 21, bring endless joy and laughter.</p><h2>‘Change the Game’ Diabetes Awareness Campaign</h2><p>As if the couple was not loved enough already, they have set another thing to like about them.</p><p>On World Diabetes Day, NFL quarterback Philip and his wife Tiffany set up a campaign, ‘Change the Game,’ to raise funds and awareness for Type 1 Diabetes.</p><p>The campaign kick-started with the swimwear brand, Hermoza, co-founded by Tiffany and her business partner, Marisa DeLecce.</p><p>Moreover, they have teamed up with three other top-recognized charities, JDRF, Insulin for Life, and Diabetes Research Connection (DRC), to raise funds.</p><p>“Hermoza is partnering with these three incredible diabetes charities this month to raise funds and awareness for a cause near and dear to us,” Marisa said.</p><p>“At Hermoza, we place a high emphasis on making the world a better place and are taking care of all hard costs, so every dollar raised through t-shirt and hat sales goes directly to these organizations. Every donation received creates an opportunity for making a difference and helping those in need.”</p><p>Many might not know this, but their son, Gunner, was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at five, changing their lives forever.</p><p>“I want to change the game not only for my son but for others with diabetes.” Philip Rivers said in the video.</p><p>“My son was diagnosed with T1D at age five and we have watched him live his life to the fullest every day since. We are thankful for the incredible diabetes organizations and experts, and hope our efforts make a difference in the lives of others living with this disease.”</p><p>Furthermore, they also emphasized how their line, Hermoza, was trying to make the world a better place.</p><p>The couple donated to one of the three designated foundations with the purchase of custom-designed ‘Change the Game’ campaign goods or any Hermoza products.</p><p>The entrant also got the chance to enter and win a complete VIP experience with end zone field seat tickets to the Oakland Raiders/Los Angeles Chargers game.&nbsp;</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>A lovable wife and a mother of nine has impeccable taste in fashion. She brings her charm to her swimwear line, Hermoza.</p><p>Even though her business is up and running, the beautiful Rivers’ net worth is still under review as of December 2023.</p><p>Her husband, Philip Rivers, has an astounding net worth of $100 million as of December 2023.</p><p>He was among the best quarterbacks to join the San Diego Chargers in the 2004 NFL Draft. Not to mention, this player made around $20 million per year in salary during his active playing days.</p><p>Likewise, Rivers signed a six-year deal with the San Diego Chargers for $92 million back in 2009 and another four-year contract of $84 million in 2015.</p><p>He converted his $6 million salary into a bonus, clearing $4.5 million in space with San Diego on September 9, 2016.</p><p>Similarly, he converted $3 million of his 2017 salary into a bonus, clearing $2 million of cap space with LAC.</p><p>On March 17, 2020, he signed a 1 year $25 million contract with Indianapolis.</p><p>Amazingly, Philip earned over $200 million in NFL just in salary alone.</p><p>However, the two have not shared much regarding their income and revenues.
