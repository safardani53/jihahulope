The actor was a super famous child actor, but his adulthood is filled with overcoming adverse trials and tribulations, including run-ins with the law.</p><p>Shaun struggled for years, and eventually, his life took a bad turn. When a mugshot of his frightfully skinny face surfaced on the internet back in 2020, fans began to wonder: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What happened to Shaun Weiss</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Shaun Weiss? He was arrested for burglary and drug possession back in 2020.</h2><p>Shaun was arrested around 7 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 26, 2020, near Marysville, Calif., per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SkyNews</a>. He was taken to the Yuba County jail, where he was held on $52,000 bail. The former actor reportedly broke into a residential property, forcing his way in via a garage window. Once inside the premises, Shaun proceeded to break into a car, where he fell asleep. That's where the homeowners found him. Shaun admitted to the crimes on the scene and was taken to custody by the Marysville Police Department.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shaun Weiss was arrested on three other separate occasions before his 2020 encounter with police.</h2><p>In July 2017, Shaun was sentenced to 150 days in the Los Angeles County Jail after stealing $151 worth of merchandise from an electronics store.</p><p>"[Shaun] hopes jail will help him, and maybe while he is in jail he will write something," his manager, Don Gibble, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> at the time.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Beast</a>, Shaun only spent 12 days in jail; the former actor was to walk free due to overcrowding. However, his newfound freedom didn't last long. Shaun was arrested just a few days after his release, and this time, it was for the possession of methamphetamine. For this crime, he was sentenced to 90 days in prison.</p><p>Shaun came under legal scrutiny once again in August 2018 when police officers found him causing a commotion near Oroville, Calif. He and two other unidentified men were reportedly using flashlights erratically, prompting a local resident to call the police. As official drug tests administered at the scene revealed, the trio had taken methamphetamine. Despite the illegality of the drug, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Beast</a>, they were let go freely.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Shaun Weiss (@shaunweiss)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Today, Shaun Weiss is two years sober and doing better than ever.</h2><p>It's clear that Shaun has been through quite a lot over the last few years in terms of his addiction battle and encounters with the law. In 2022, however, he is a changed man. The actor has seemingly done a 180-degree turn and looks happier and healthier than ever. Taking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> on Jan. 26, 2022, Shaun shared a before-and-after shot of him during the height of his methamphetamine addiction and himself today as a sober individual.</p><p>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with 12 amazing steps," his caption under the post read. Shaun then reposted the comparison image yet again, this time accompanied by a caption that thanked fans using prayer hands and a heart emoji for their support.</p><p>The star also used his platform to encourage others dealing with similar issues to seek help. On his page, he shared, "If you or someone you know is in need of treatment — 866-480-2496."</p><p>One thing is for certain, fans are glad to see the star doing well once again.</p><p>"Keep going! Congratulations! One day at a time. Recovery for Sobriety [sic] is an amazing thing," commented one user on Instagram.</p><p>"Two years sober and about 20 years younger-looking," chimed in another.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shaun Weiss appeared in several hit TV series including 'The Cosby Show.'</h2><p>The actor rose to fame with a stint in the 1986 Pee-wee's Playhouse, in which he played Elvis.
