The musical comedy follows the story of Asha who “makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force — a little ball of boundless energy called Star,” according to Disney’s official logline. While DeBose’s Asha is the protagonist of the movie, she’s up against Pine’s villainous king character."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Pine was, admittedly, <a href=#>nervous to sing</a> alongside DeBose — a <a href=#>Tony Award</a> and <a href=#>Oscar</a> winner — in the film.</p><p>“It’s just not something I do on a daily basis,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a> earlier this month. “When you’re singing opposite Ariana … it’s a big deal.”</p><p>DeBose, for her part, praised Pine’s vocal abilities.</p><p>“He can sing! He can absolutely sing,” she gushed. “When I found out that I was cast in this film, I was like, ‘Oh!’ I mean, did you see him in <a href=#>Into the Woods</a>? … I think Chris is one of those examples of not understanding just how talented he is.”</p><p>She continued to say that Pine portrays a “delicious” villain.</p><p>“I love the sound of his voice, the way that he molds words,” DeBose added. “You know people are going to love to hate him, and I just love watching him work.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a breakdown of Wish’s star-studded cast:</p><h3>Ariana DeBose</h3><p>DeBose stars as Asha, a teen who wishes upon a star in order to save the Kingdom of Rosas.</p><h3>Chris Pine</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/A-Guide-to-Disney-Wish-Stars-2.jpg><p>Pine plays the villainous King Magnifico who keeps the citizens’ wishes under his control — and never grants any wishes.</p><h3>Alan Tudyk</h3><p>The actor voices the goat, Valentino, because no Disney movie is complete without an animal sidekick. Tudyk is certainly qualified for animal sidekick duty. He previously voiced pet bug Tuk Tuk in Raya and the Last Dragon as well as Heihei, a scene-stealing chicken, in <a href=#>Moana</a>.</p><h3>Angelique Cabral</h3><p>Cabral’s character, Queen Amaya, is married to King Magnifico.</p><h3>Victor Garber</h3><p>He plays Sabino, Asha’s grandfather, who is celebrating his 100th birthday and waiting for his wish to be granted.</p><h3>Harvey Guillén</h3><p>Various characters were inspired by the dwarfs from <a href=#>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>. Guillén, for example, voices Gabo, who is compared to Snow White’s Grumpy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/A-Guide-to-Disney-Wish-Stars-3.jpg><h3>Evan Peters</h3><p>Peters plays the role of Simon, who was inspired by Snow White’s Sleepy.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>Ramy Youssef</h3><p>Youssef’s character, Simon, suffers from various allergies — making him similar Snow White’s Sneezy.</p><p><strong>Natasha Rothwell</strong>, <strong>Jennifer Kumiyama</strong>, <strong>Niko Vargas</strong>, <strong>Jon Rudnitsky</strong> and <strong>Della Saba</strong> also star in the film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuiq56axrR51qKqoWWTlsC1ec2oq5qanJp6r63Mnqpmrp%2BesKq6xmaroZ1dlruqucCtnJ1lk52us63CrZyrq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
