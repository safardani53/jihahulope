The 30-year-old was pictured in a casual ensemble that featured <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>grey sweatpants</a>, a long-sleeved black sweater, and opted to tie her blonde tresses up in a messy bun. Meanwhile, Ethan, who reportedly recently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for divorce</a> from his wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lilly Jay</strong></a>, sported a similar outfit. He rocked a grey crewneck sweatshirt and black trousers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>A guest of the resort told the outlet that, “Ariana was sitting next to Ethan and [they were with] another woman, who looked like an assistant or a PA, and another guy.” The rumored couple was spotted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eating breakfast</a> while at Soho Farmhouse. “They were eating breakfast – and they wanted to take a picture of a poached egg that got dropped on the floor by a waitress as she was bringing it over to them.
