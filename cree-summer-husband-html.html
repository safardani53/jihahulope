And for a while, everything seemed to go well in their marriage. But the couple privately parted ways circa 2019.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Cree Summer Separated from Husband</h2><p>On December 31, 2019, Summer uploaded a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cryptic post</a> on her Instagram. She shared a picture of herself and expressed 2019 was one of the worst years of her life. Without detailing much, she mentioned her pain had a silver lining.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>She spoke of how&nbsp;her savages gave her millions of reasons to smile, and her sisters made her laugh even when she didn't want to. She added that the gifts she received after the&nbsp;troubling times were deeper than the sea.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Although the post made no sense to what went wrong in her life that year, the reason became apparent when she alluded she had separated from her husband. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On December 29, 2020, the Los Angeles native&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted a picture</a> of herself with her daughters. Then, in the caption, she remarked being a single mother wasn't for the weak.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"Thank you creator for my babies, this deed, scared sacrifice," she penned before stating she was humbled by the responsibility of a mother.</p><p>Although she clarified she was no longer with her husband, the&nbsp;talented voice actress didn't share the reason behind their separation. Moreover, she didn't even detail when they had separated.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Could Cree Summer Be Dating Her Ex-Boyfriend?</h2><p>On November 12, 2020, Summer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted a video</a> with fellow&nbsp;K.C. Undercover actor&nbsp;Kadeem Hardison on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The clip saw the duo singing&nbsp;Marvin Gaye and&nbsp;Tammi Terrell's all-time hit song, 'Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing.' In the caption, Summer noted they had played Dwayne Cleofis Wayne and Winnifred "Freddie"&nbsp;Brooks in the '90s sitcom A Different World.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Then Hardison dedicated a sweet <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birthday post</a> for his daughter, Sophia Hardison, on September 28, 2021. Meanwhile, Summer entered the comment section, wishing the 25-year-old. She wrote, "sending love,&nbsp;25 whoa. Time&nbsp;does speed by." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Their close rapport has everyone wondering if they are more than just co-stars and friends. After all, years before Summer tied the knot with her ex-husband, she was in a relationship with Hardison.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The pair reportedly dated for a year and broke up on good terms.&nbsp;In an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with People</a> back in 1992,&nbsp;Summer described him as a "gentle, gentle man."&nbsp;She even added, "everyone who meets him falls in love with him."&nbsp;</p><p>However, no conclusion can be made until the 52-year-old or Hardison open up about their relationship.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuimrJuv9SmpJ6qXZ3CtK7Ap5tnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
