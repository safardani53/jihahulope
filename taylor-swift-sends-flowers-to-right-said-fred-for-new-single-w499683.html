Because of the way we delivered the [original] song … we took our shirts off and acted like idiots, so we sold the song in a very different way. But I think she’s done a very interesting thing. But I like the track, I like the darkness of it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Swift will premiere the music video for “Look What You Made Me Do,” which is the first single from her upcoming sixth album, <i>Reputation</i>, at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday, August 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdqLKvsNJmnaWnp5q%2FtHnTqGSroZedwW6%2FwKKbZp6imrFuss6rZKedp2LAqrrGpZxmr2RuhneEkmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
