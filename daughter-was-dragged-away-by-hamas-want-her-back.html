Are you ok?'</p><p>"She wrote back to me: 'We're in the safe room. I've never heard anything like this in my life'.''</p><p>That was the last time they communicated.</p><p>It wasn't until four hours later when Naama's 52-year-old father, Yoni Levy, phoned that the full scale of <a href=#>horror</a> began to unravel.</p><p>The mother-of-four was on the front porch, playing a monopoly board game with Naama's siblings, when she received a call from her husband.</p><p>He told her: " Something bad's going on. There's a video of Naama being kidnapped to Gaza-the video is in Gaza."</p><p>Panic struck Dr Levy-Shachar and her children as they began to frantically search social media.</p><p>Naama's brother, Amit, 21, quickly found the horrifying footage and warned his mother not to watch it.</p><p>In the chilling video, the teenager is seen being thrown into a black jeep by her hair with her sweatpants covered in blood.</p><p>Naama's younger sister, Michal, 16, then watched the video and began crying at the terrifying scenes she saw, asking: "Why is she alone?"</p><p>Dr Levy-Shachar said: "There are so many specific details in that video. Her terrified face, her being dragged by the hair, her bloody sweatpants, pyjamas, her wounds.</p><p>"But what her sister saw was that she was alone. That was the most terrifying part for her."</p><p>She added: "I understood that something terrible is happening; just through her eyes, through my younger daughter's eyes."</p><p>During<a href=#> a week-long truce deal</a>, Hamas released 105 people held hostage in Gaza.</p><p>But according to Israel, 136 citizens still remain in captivity, including Naama.</p><p>Seeing other families reunite with their loved ones last month was "unbearable" for Dr Levy-Shachar as she awaited her daughter's return with a "welcome home" board.</p><p>With her voice trembling, she told<a href=#> Daily Mail</a>: "I'm happy for everyone who got out, but she is my daughter.</p><p>"The world has continued, people are continuing with their lives and <a href=#>Christmas</a> is coming, but everything has stopped for us."</p><p>The devastated mother has previously <a href=#>called on the world to bring her daughter home, </a>saying every minute since her "baby girl" was abducted felt like an "eternity in hell".</p><p>One glimmer of hope came from released hostages who confirmed they had seen Naama still alive.</p><p>"We know she has some wounds, but she's up on her feet and she's walking - so I'm very hopeful," the mother said.</p><p>"When I talk, I have my soft voice, and my words come out slowly, but I want mothers around the world to hear my scream - and to take action," she added.</p><p>The doctor said she doesn't hate her daughter's abductors, adding that she "has to hope".</p><p>"Maybe one of them, they have a heart.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"They can see that lovely little girl; they can be good to her and keep her from harm.</p><p>"I don't want to be hateful- I just want her back," she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gentle-loving-teen-daughter-pulled-866894468.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4JxhJBvb21nlJbCqLTTnqlmr5GoeqW%2BwKCenpxdlsSixYybsGagkaKutHnWmqWtZZiav26uwJyiaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
