For one of her beach looks, she wore a super revealing black bikini, which just barely covered up her top and bottom half. The bathing suit also had strings tied around Emily’s toned stomach, but there was still plenty of skin on full display. She confidently strutted through the sand as she rocked the revealing look to perfection!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/emily-ratajkowski-birthday-sexiest-bikinis-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>It’s not just two-pieces that Emily is a pro at rocking, though. During another Miami trip, she sunbathed while wearing a super sexy one-piece suit, which had a majorly plunging neckline. the bathing suit was barely anything but two strips of fabric down her chest, which met in the middle to cover the bottom portion of her body. There may have been a major risk of wardrobe malfunction, but Emily definitely didn’t look bothered as she sprawled out on a lounge chair in the look! She completed the look with an animal print bucket hat.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>For another one of her luxurious vacations, Emily also hit up France, where she was photographed wearing a teal green bikini. This one actually offered much more coverage than the others we’re used to seeing Emily wear, but her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rock-hard abs</a> were definitely still front and center in the two-piece.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>There are plenty of more amazing swimsuit looks from Emily where these came from!
