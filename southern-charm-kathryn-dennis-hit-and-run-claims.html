Unit one was a pedestrian. The pedestrian did receive medical attention at the scene of the collision. Unit two was a 2022 Ford Utility vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>“Unit one, the pedestrian, a school resource officer, was directing traffic in a working capacity in front of Whitesville Elementary School. Unit number two, the Ford Utility vehicle, was traveling south on&nbsp;Gaillard&nbsp;Road.”</p><p>The statement continued that the driver of the Ford struck the pedestrian and did not stop at the scene of the collision.</p><p>Police later found the registered owner of the car to be former Southern Charm star Kathryn Dennis.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Kathryn Dennis">Read more on Kathryn Dennis</h2><p>The U.S. Sun could confirm the town of the address is where Kathryn is a resident, though police could not confirm it is the Southern Charm star. &nbsp;</p><p>The Southern Charm alum has not been charged or arrested at this time, as the collision remains under investigation.</p><p>A rep for Kathryn did not immediately respond to The U.S. Sun's request for comment.</p><p><a href=#>The Ashley's Reality Roundup</a> was the first to report on the story.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>CUSTODY DRAMA</h2><p>The accident comes after a difficult year for Kathryn.&nbsp;</p><p>Her ex-boyfriend&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas</a>&nbsp;Ravenel&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filed for sole custody of their children Kensington, 9, and Saint, 7,</a>&nbsp;and has requested&nbsp;Kathryn have supervised visitation with the kids on October 23, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Sun broke the news of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Southern Charm</a>&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily losing custody</a>&nbsp;of their two children in February 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">South Carolina</a>&nbsp;judge officially granted Thomas full&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">custody</a>&nbsp;on February 6, 2023, after Kathryn "failed multiple drug tests," a source claimed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All About The Tea</a>&nbsp;was the first to break the custody win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A source confirmed to The U.S. Sun: “Thomas won the court case and was granted sole custody of the kids.”</p><p>The source claimed the custody ruling came after Kathryn failed numerous drug tests.</p><p>The insider alleged: “She tested positive for three illegal drugs.”</p><p>The source also claimed Thomas’ legal team had a mountain of evidence of neglect against the fired&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Southern Charm star</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the judge decided to give the former politician sole custody because of the children’s progress while in his care full time.&nbsp;</p><p>The insider said: “Thomas’ legal team had affidavits from the speech therapists, an occupational therapist, physical therapist and play therapists that the children were making tremendous progress under his parenting.</p><p>“They were doing well in school, enjoying play dates and were happy. They love school and living in Aiken.”</p><p>Kathryn has supervised visitation from 9 am to 4:30 pm every other Saturday and Sunday, according to the source.</p><p>The insider added: "So far, everything is going well. Kathryn has been adhering surprisingly well to the order. Thomas wishes the best for her."</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">custody case was sealed</a>&nbsp;after Kathryn's legal team put in a request to the judge.</p><p>A second source close to Kathryn confirmed to The U.S. Sun that she lost custody of the children.</p><p>Kathryn's lawyer told The U.S. Sun: "I am prohibited from speaking about this matter because the case is sealed."</p><p>A rep for Kathryn did not respond to The U.S. Sun's request for comment regarding the custody loss.</p><h2>THOMAS' FIGHT</h2><p>The U.S. Sun broke the news of Thomas’&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">request to change their custody agreement</a>&nbsp;from joint to primary custody, as he cited Kathryn’s alleged drug abuse and neglect.&nbsp;</p><p>In South Carolina court records obtained by The U.S. Sun, Thomas claimed a mutual friend told him about a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent trip</a>&nbsp;he took to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">North Carolina</a>&nbsp;with Kathryn, her then-<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">boyfriend Chleb Ravenell</a>, Kensie, Saint, and others.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas claimed the friend said: “He informed me that he witnessed a lot of cocaine use during this trip and that Kathryn had left cocaine within the grasp of the children, which he thought was dangerous.”</p><p>Kathryn alleged in her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">court</a>&nbsp;response: “I do not use cocaine so naturally I have not left any out for our children to access.”</p><p>She also agreed to take a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">drug test</a>&nbsp;as long as Thomas pays for it and takes one as well.</p><p><a href=#>Thomas</a>, 61, went on to claim that he hired a man to conduct surveillance on her.&nbsp;</p><p>The man allegedly witnessed the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Southern Charm</a>&nbsp;star leaving the children home alone unsupervised on multiple occasions, noting one time in July at 1:48 am in August, at 3:17 am, and others, according to court papers.</p><p>Thomas wrote in the court papers of one alleged instance: “During the time Kathryn was gone, Kensie and Saint are seen alone in front of the house. THIS IS TERRIFYING.”</p><p>He also mentioned how a neighbor called the police after allegedly finding Saint wandering around a busy road unsupervised.</p><p>Kathryn responded in her court filing that it is “untrue” that she left the children home alone.&nbsp;</p><p>She admitted her father fell asleep while watching the children and Saint wandered outside. The reality star said her father has not watched their children since.&nbsp;</p><h2>'FILTHY AND UNKEMPT'</h2><p>Thomas said Kathryn had failed to get the children to school on time.</p><p>Kathryn admitted in her filing that her daughter has been late to school four times this year, and three of those tardies were during her visitation period.&nbsp;</p><p>He said the children come to him from their mother's home allegedly “filthy and unkempt," according to the court documents.</p><p>He claimed: “When the children are picked up after their week with Kathryn, they are filthy, their hair is matted, they smell and they are unusually tired and irritable.&nbsp;</p><p>“During the summer they were routinely returned without shoes. Saint is regularly returned wearing clothes that are so small on him, they leave marks on his skin.”</p><p>Kathryn&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">responded to the claim</a>: “This is untrue. My children are always well dressed and clean when in my care and I am often complimented on how cute they look.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kathryn has generally denied Thomas’ claims of substance abuse in the past.</p><h2>'CHILDREN'S BEST INTEREST'</h2><p>In court papers, he wrote he believes it is in the children’s best interests to move with them to his estate in Aiken, South Carolina, as he can maintain a “safe, stable and secure environment” for them.&nbsp;</p><p>The children currently&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live in an Aiken mansion</a>&nbsp;with their dad, who is also father to a young son from a previous relationship.</p><p>Thomas claimed in court papers that he never wanted to deprive Kensie and Saint ample time with their mother and that Kathryn loves their children.&nbsp;</p><p>He continued: “But I have been terrified for years that they continue to be put in harm’s way every time they are in her care.</p><p>“However, I could not and cannot ignore the accumulation of evidence that Kathryn continues to put our children in harm’s way.”</p><p>Thomas continued in the court documents: “Kathryn cannot be allowed to play Russian Roulette with our children’s lives.&nbsp;</p><p>"Unless the Court intervenes to protect Kensie and Saint, it is not a matter of ‘if,’ it is a matter of ‘when’ until something devastating happens to them while under Kathryn’s care.”</p><h2>PAST COURT BATTLE</h2><p>Kathryn lost full custody of the children in 2016 and entered rehab after she tested positive for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">marijuana</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, she filed for primary custody of the kids after Thomas was arrested and charged with assault and battery in the second degree.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pleaded guilty</a>&nbsp;to third-degree assault and battery charges.&nbsp; He received a 30-day suspended sentence and was ordered to pay a $500 fine.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, the exes agreed to share joint legal and physical custody of their children with Thomas “being the primary custodian.”</p><h2>KATHRYN'S FIRING</h2><p>The U.S. Sun reported in January that Kathryn was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fired from South Charm</a>&nbsp;after eight seasons for treating those on set badly and being regularly late.</p><p>A source claimed: “Kathryn is not in a good place at the moment, regardless of what she shows on social media.</p><p>"She was so messed up on the last season, drinking too much and coming to work hungover.&nbsp;</p><p>"All these Bravo events are open bar, and they drink at every gathering on TV. She loves her dark liquor. She was showing up drunk sometimes too and continues to drink.”</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">source continued to clai</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>m</a>: "They often had to edit her out, and this is one of the reasons she was cut as a main cast member on the show.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Friends and cast members are worried about her and think she should maybe get treatment, or go to rehab.</p><p>"It's actually sad, she's always had problems but her mom’s death hit her hard, and her mom did so much for her, she’s struggled to function alone at times.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/NINTCHDBPICT000797763509.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/www-instagram-com-p-cvn2b82n8bf-854419921.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/southern-charms-kathryn-dennis-officially-797762950.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxY26CcYCYaKqoraSdsrO6jJyfmqqdYriiwMersKdllJq7r7XSZp%2BirF2Wu6V50a6lZpuclrauv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
