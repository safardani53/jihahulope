The social media influencer, also known as Coutney Tailor, was detained in Hawaii on Wednesday. She is presently awaiting extradition to Florida, where she will face second-degree murder charges for the alleged April death of her lover. As a result of her post-traumatic stress illness and drug misuse, the model was first admitted to a treatment clinic in Hawaii. Her attorney, however, reported that she has now been apprehended by authorities.</p><p>Courtney Clenney’s mugshot has gone popular on social media since it was made public, and the Midland, Texas native seems obviously sorry in the photo.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>NEW: Tonight’s booking photo of accused Miami murderer, Courtney Clenney, who was arrested in Hawaii, where she was in rehab. She’s accused of stabbing to death her boyfriend, Christian Obumseli April 3. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@wsvn</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j73Mm7fwp3</a></p><p>— Sheldon Fox-7 News (@fox_sheldon) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 11, 2022</a></p><p>Frank Prieto, her defense attorney, expressed disbelief at her detention and stated:</p><p>“I’m very startled, particularly since we were helping with the inquiry and promised to surrender her freely if she was accused.” We are excited to clear her name in court.”</p><h2>All About Courtney Clenney</h2><p>The 25-year-old was born on April 21, 1996, and has developed a sizable fan base on Instagram, where she has over two million followers. Clenney became an influencer after participating in various modeling contests.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Courtney-Clenney-2.jpg alt="Courtney Clenney" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She has subsequently featured in commercials for Pepsi, Celebration Church, Cirrus Logic, and Discount Dollars. Courtney Clenney also made a brief appearance on television and in the movies. She appeared in many films, including The Lying Game, Unstalkable, Boyhood, American Psycho, and Everybody Wants Some!!</p><h2>What happen to Courtney Clenney and Christian Obumseli?</h2><p>At about 5 p.m. on April 3, 2022, the police apparently got a panicked contact from the Instagram model. She informed authorities that she was in a confrontation with Obumseli when he suddenly grabbed her neck, prompting her to stab him in self-defense. When officers arrived at the residence, they discovered the guy covered in blood and transported him to the hospital, where he was declared dead.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Courtney-Clenney-3.jpg alt="Courtney Clenney" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Courtney Clenney’s blood-splattered high-rise condominium in Miami has also been seen on video.&nbsp;The couple had just been together for around two years and were separated at the time of the heinous crime. They lived together for many months in the apartment complex, where employees saw multiple incidences of domestic violence and even attempted to evict them.&nbsp;Obumseli’s relatives and friends chastised law enforcement for not charging Courtney Clenney sooner. Larry Handfield, the Obumseli family’s attorney, stated:</p><p>“All the family wants is accountability.” That is all the family want. Courtney claimed self-defense, and they believed her, therefore there was no need for an inquiry. The investigator arrived at his conclusion less than 24 hours after arriving on the site. That is very wrong and should never happen.”</p><p>At the time of writing, no more information on Clenney’s arrest has been made public. The Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office said in a news release that further information regarding the murder investigation would be released at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Courtney Clenney</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Instagram star</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaqK2iqbumxYyco56mnprGbq3NZqCnq6SWtLOtzGaqrZmiYsSiv4yaqaudo6mypXnFqKlmq6SWr6O1zaBkoZ2iYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
