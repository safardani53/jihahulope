Lip fillers were&nbsp;<a href=#>banned for under 18</a>s after our campaign.</p><p>Dr Perry said you should avoid procedures that have an&nbsp;adverse risk ratio to results.</p><p>He explained that such risks can be infection, blood clots, skin irregularities, swelling, deformity and persistent discomfort as well as poor success rate.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to non-surgical procedures, Dr Perry said nose jobs with dermal fillers run the risk of skin loss and slight loss when there is only a minimal improvement as the risk is just not worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He added: "‘Plexr’ or plasma which is meant to help with upper eyelids by essentially burning the skin to cause it shrivel and often leaves scars and does not even work."</p><p>Dr Perry said that patients who have had fat freezing for a double chin are often unhappy as the procedure is often not very effective.</p><p>When it comes to surgical procedures, he warned that you should be on your guard.</p><p>He said: "Going abroad is foolish as the complications from work abroad are numerous and patients seem happy to the risk their faces and body for saving money.</p><p>"It would be better to be patient and wait and save to have it done by a reputable BAAPS trained surgeon in the UK.</p><p>"Getting a deal/offer is madness and is now against guidelines so if they are offering deals and discounts then you need to be wary as they are treating you as another ‘number’ and not a patient."</p><p>He said you should always look at the risks involved on the consent form and whether or not the clinic is happy accept responsibility if anything goes wrong.</p><p>He said there are some procedure you should avoid or consider as a 'last resort'.</p><p>He explained: "One stitch facelifts are not common place as reputable surgeons don’t offer them as they don’t work or are of limited value.</p><p>"Butt lifts &nbsp;or BBL (Brazilian butt lift) are very high risk with using your own fat or implant and young fit and well patients have died from this procedure, is it really worth the risk?"</p><p>Dr Perry also highlighted labiaplasty – and said that this is only really recommended if the labia is above normal size which is usually around 2cm, but that 4cm is also considered normal unless you are in discomfort.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He said: "Otherwise the rise of pornography and expectations of the ‘designer vagina’ with small or no labia trends see more people possibly undergoing this procedure without due consideration for the psychological impact it may have on them.</p><p>"So again needs very careful consideration and seek expert opinion."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>I’ve spent £37k changing my face, mum helped me pay for 4 nose jobs and 3 sets of lips but I felt better before</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxygpZqbnBrY2SxsK%2FTqKlmpJmleqe1y6Wcq6tdnbKzvMSsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
