The Gist: 
CM Punk was a mentor to Seth Rollins early in Seth's career, but Seth has said that CM has become &#34;self-centered&#34; in more recent years. Seth and CM have had a war of words for some time, and Seth's animosity toward CM seems very genuine, as was his disappointment when CM returned to WWE."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The two seemed to have been on good terms with one another when CM left WWE in 2014, but in the years since, their relationship has undeniably soured.</p><p>The feud seems to have started after CM got into commentating. In 2019, he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE Backstage</a> "I want my journalistic integrity to be intact, so this isn't the show where you come on and shoot your little angles."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Seth (Rollins) needs to stop tweeting and realize that sometimes it's better to be viewed as the fool and shut your mouth, or open your mouth and remove all doubt," he added.
