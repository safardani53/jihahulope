The two play a flaky New York Couple who long for a home of their own, but because of the economy and faltering careers, they reluctantly settle for living with his obnoxious brother in Georgia.</p><p>En route to their new Southern home, they stop at a B&B, which turns out to be a commune. There, they meet nudists, smoke pot and even participate in an orgy. Aniston, who plays Linda, has sex with two men and a woman who gives birth moments later.</p><p>In another scene of the flick, of which <strong>Judd Apatow</strong> (Knocked Up, Superbad) produces, the group protests an expansion of a Wal-Mart, and Aniston's character lifts her shirt to flash the news cameras.</p><p>Aniston and Rudd also decide to live on the commune, where they end up opening a book publishing company.</p><p>Aniston plays a potty-mouth dentist in Horrible Bosses (also starring <strong>Jamie Foxx, Jason Bateman</strong> and <strong>Colin Farrell</strong>), which depicts the lives of three friends annoyed with their careers who decide they should kill their managers to ease frustration.</p><p>At the beginning of the movie, Aniston — who is one of the bosses — fondles a patient under anesthesia, and then propositions her hygienist. Later, the hygienist comes to her office, and she opens her lab coat to reveal she's completely naked. She threatens to tell his fiancee they're having an affair unless he sleeps with her.</p><p>When Aniston gets wind of the plot to kill the bosses, she invites the hygienist's fiancee to the office for some free dental work. While she's passed out, Aniston suggests they have sex on top of her. "Let's use her as a table — I like that idea!" she says.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Aniston could certainly use some buzz in her career.
