He received widespread praise, and the movie opened a significant career trajectory for the young talent.&nbsp;</p><p>Hilton Als, a celebrated critic at the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">New Yorker</a>, applauded the exceptional Barry Jenkins movie, its&nbsp;setting, and actors' performance.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Looking at what Als had to say about Sander's portrayal of Chiron, Sanders' performance left a mark on the seasoned critic. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The critic praised Sanders's capability to wholly occupy the character and "inhabit the reality of the moment."&nbsp;</p><p>Watching Sanders play Chiron at this stage of his life is rather like seeing Montgomery Clift act for the first time, or Gloria Foster in 'Nothing But a Man.'&nbsp;There’s no accounting for talent like this. Sanders has a conjurer’s gifts, and an intuitive understanding of how the camera works.</p><p>The coming-of-age movie was a recipient of numerous awards, shattering records in the process. It became the first movie featuring an all-black cast to win the Best Picture Oscar. Similarly, it was the first LQBTQ-related movie to win the prestigious award.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Sanders <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">feels honored</a> about the acclaim and recognition the movie received. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>&nbsp;It’s dope that people are respecting real work and stories of people in real-life situations,&nbsp;It was an honour, yo.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, the <a href=# rel=follow>actor</a>&nbsp;opened up to Another Man magazine about his childhood,&nbsp;Moonlight&nbsp;experience, and upcoming projects.

After the film opened to rapturous review, the actor's life became all about press tours, Golden Globes, and Oscars. He expressed his Oscar moment as something entirely surreal. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Every actor’s dream, standing on that stage at the Oscars, looking out at an audience of people I’ve been looking up to</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Moonlight made Sanders an overnight star.
