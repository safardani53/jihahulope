After Ali was diagnosed with a rare form of muscular dystrophy (MD) in 2014, Leah has been open about her and her daughter’s journey through chronic illness. In an update from a recent doctor’s appointment, Leah couldn’t contain her excitement for Ali’s progress, sweetly shouting out all her effort in the caption: ” Keep working hard and staying dedicated Ali girl.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the post, Leah shared a sweet series of snapshots of Ali’s latest visit with <strong>Dr. Tsao </strong>at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Ohio. Alongside sweet selfies of the mother-daughter duo together at the appointment, Leah shared the incredible news she received from the doctor in her caption. “He sees more of an improvement than he ever has, mind & body. He said what he sees is remarkable because she seems a lot stronger,” Leah gushed. “700+ of her type of #MuscularDystrophy. He gave a lot of credit to her love, hard work and dedication to reaching horseback riding goals that she sets for herself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/leah-messer-and-her-kids-splash-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Leah even revealed Dr. Tsao asked to take a picture with Ali after delivering the good news, and Leah shared how “grateful” the family is for his “guidance” over the years. Leah shares daughter Ali and her twin sister <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Aleeah</strong></a>, with ex-husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Corey Simms</strong></a>. Though&nbsp;Teen Mom 2&nbsp;has never shied from interpersonal drama over six seasons and counting, Leah’s sweet relationship with her twins and youngest daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Adalynn</strong></a>, who she shares with ex <strong>Jeremy Calvert</strong>, has been a grounding force. Leah hit this home as well with her caption, including the hashtag “Never Lose Hope.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Regardless of the drama, Leah’s TM2 crew showed up to support Ali’s inspiring progress, and their beautiful bond. Co-star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chelsea Houska</strong></a> took to Leah’s comments section to share just how moved she was by the update. “This gave me goosebumps!” she wrote. “So incredible!!” Leah’s sister <strong>Victoria Messer</strong>, who was featured in the season premiere of ‘Teen Mom: Family Reunion‘ earlier this month, also showed her love for her niece, commenting three simple hearts that said it all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BxZqWdkZ16rrHSrJyrZZSWwqi0056pZpmcnnquwdKcrKWZomKxur%2FTq6apoKliwbO1wa6rnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
