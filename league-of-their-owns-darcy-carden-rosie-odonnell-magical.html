Abbi Jacobson and D’Arcy Carden lead the upcoming sports comedy-drama, which premieres on Friday, August 12.

We were pretty thrilled by it,” Carden, 42, exclusively <a href=#>told Us Weekly of having O’Donnell on set.</a> “She just knew what the movie meant to us. She didn’t pretend like it wasn’t a thing because it was a thing. She let us ask a million questions and she told us little behind-the-scenes stories and went into her like Penny Marshall voice and her <a href=#><strong>Madonna</strong></a> voice and everything. And we were just sort of giddy and surrounding her. I remember her little chair was set up and everybody’s chair was spread out throughout the room and by the end of it, everybody’s chair was right up against her. Like story time. We were thrilled to have her. She was amazing.”</p><p><a href=#>‘A League of Their Own’ Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></p><p>O’Donnell appeared in the beloved film alongside Madonna, 63,<a href=#><strong> Geena Davis</strong></a>, <strong>Lori Petty</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a>, with the late Marshall as director.

I don’t know in what situation I’ve ever gotten to do that before,” Carden tells Us of the training. “Usually when you meet a cast, it’s often on set or sometimes it’s like the day before at a table read and you have to sort of, like, fake all this chemistry. And we got months of playing baseball together and months of these early morning training sessions. And we really came together as a team and supported each other and had to be vulnerable with how good or not good we were at baseball and how to get better. We really relied on each other and leaned on each other. To bring that to the show, it was almost like the acting was an afterthought. Or this show was an afterthought. We were like this baseball team that happened to be on a show together. It was really fun. I know I can feel it. It was so easy to act with them because this was just my team that I had been with for so long.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/League-Their-Owns-DArcy-Carden-Rosie-ODonnell-Was-Magical-Set-0002.jpg><p>Although the series detours away from the movie, Carden can relate to Davis and Petty’s sisters Dottie and Kit.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve watched it a million times. What’s funny is I definitely thought of myself as a Kit. But I recently watched it a couple weeks ago and I was like, ‘Oh wow. I’m really finding myself relating to Dottie more.’ Which I know happens as we age, we relate to different characters, you know? And I think Abbi is so scrappy and she has some real Kit vibes, but she’s a leader and she can be kind of stoic. It’s funny. I feel like I’m a little bit Kit and a little bit Dottie. And I feel like Abbi’s a little bit Kit and a little bit Dottie. But like the other sides of them,” she says, laughing. “The two of us make up the two of them. There’s someone for everybody in that movie. It’s so exciting to have anything in the world of A League of Their Own [so] getting to do the show is beyond surreal.”</p><p>A League of Their Own premieres on Prime Video on Friday, August 12.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOemZeqsm67xWaroZ2Zp3qww82sZJ2ZopjGbq%2FAq5uepl2nvLS1xGamnaeeo7KtuIymmKChk5a5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
