Maybe a future biopic role? Understandably, Angus isn't ready to tackle that topic just yet," the publication later wrote on the topic. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cloud was previously asked the same question&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">during an interview</a>&nbsp;in February 2022, and his response was also the same. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He stated that he wouldn't be able to play a real person, whom he respected a lot and regarded as a legend.</p><p>"I mean, no, I don't think so," he said. "Taking on someone's whole life and becoming that person like, how much respect you have to give them to actually try to portray them, you know?

Three months after his death, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office released the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official toxicology report</a>&nbsp;in November 2018, confirming that he died of an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine, and alcohol. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The coroner noted that Miller's death was accidental due to "mixed drug toxicity" from what was deemed "recreational" drug usage.</p><p>On the other hand, Miller, who does not have a history with drugs in real life, plays the character of a kind-hearted drug dealer, Fezco, in the HBO series&nbsp;Euphoria.</p><p>Since being tagged as a kind-hearted dealer, he even prevents Rue Bennett, played by actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Zendaya</a>, from using Fentanyl, a highly addictive drug, despite her dire requests during episode 2 of the first season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"Angus Cloud (Fezco in #Euphoria) looks and sounds a lot like Mac Miller...The similarity is impressive and the fact that Fez takes care of Rue (a drug addict play by Zendaya) makes me speechless because Mac died from a fentanyl overdose," one tweeted.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>breaking all my locals hearts by telling them angus cloud said he’d never do a mac miller biopic, the way facebook was intended to be used — dominic fike’s only fan (@noabournexo) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">March 1, 2022</a></p><p><br>Another wrote, "if they ever do a biopic for Mac Miller Angus Cloud should be offered the role."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>But all fan speculations aside, Cloud has already made his intentions on the matter clear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmenMK0ecKlpq6cXaKupHnMoqOlnaJir6q7z6KaZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
