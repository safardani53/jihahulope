But I know it comes from a place of hurt.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Caroline, who <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>also had a falling out</a> with Teresa, 50, on RHONJ, recalled how Teresa and Jacqueline, 52, had a “true friendship” before they became enemies on the show.&nbsp;“In those years, it just went awry, because it was chaos,” Caroline said. “Season 3, season 4, was absolute chaos. That [their friendship] was collateral damage. So I’m truly very happy for them both.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rhonj-carolina-teresa-jacky-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Caroline <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirmed</a> that she hasn’t spoken to Jacqueline about her reunion with Teresa, which happened last month in Las Vegas, where Jacqueline now lives with her husband&nbsp;<strong>Chris Laurita</strong> (who is Caroline’s brother). “I watch from afar,” Caroline cryptically said. “The same thing when <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dolores [Catania]</strong></a> is in the middle of filming. Stay there. We’ll talk after.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Speaking about her five-season run on RHONJ&nbsp;that ended in 2013, Caroline said, “<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I walked away from it</a> so many years ago, and I’m happy with the decision that I made. I just don’t want to be involved in any of the mess.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jacqueline’s reunion with Teresa happened after she started bashing&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Melissa Gorga</strong></a> on social media, which fans thought was suspicious, since Teresa and Melissa <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>aren’t speaking</a> right now. But, Caroline <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told us</a> that she doesn’t think the Giudice-Gorga family drama is why Jacqueline finally made up with Teresa.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“Jacqueline has her reasons. Again, haven’t talked to her about it. But I know that Jacqueline is very methodical about in how she thinks and why she does what she does,” the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Food, Love and Chaos with Caroline Manzo</a> host said. “I know a lot of people had a lot to say at BravoCon when I was talking to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joe [Gorga]</strong></a> and Melissa. You know, alright, cool, think what you wanna think. I’m a big girl with a mind of my own and I make my own decisions. I was very happy to see them. They have never given me cause to have any kind of issue or dislike them in any way. And they are a lot of fun. I have no issues with them.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“I’m not gonna question Jacqueline,” Caroline added. “There’s a reason why she’s saying that. Don’t know what it is. Don’t care what it is. Don’t wanna hear what it is. But I disagree with her there. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I have no issue with the Gorgas</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>You can listen to Caroline’s full interview on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spotify</a>.
