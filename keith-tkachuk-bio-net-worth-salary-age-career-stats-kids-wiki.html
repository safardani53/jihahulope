Furthermore, Tkachuk grew up playing hockey with his siblings, <strong>Kevin Tkachuk</strong> and <strong>Mary Kay Tkachuk.</strong></p><p>Therefore, ever since he was a child, the Massachusetts native dreamed of playing in the NHL.</p><p>Consequently, when the future Hall of Famer joined Malden Catholic High School, the first thing he did was to join the high school hockey team.</p><p>Subsequently, Tkachuk impressed many observers with his raw talent and winning mentality playing for the Malden Catholic High School.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tkachuk-290.jpg></p><p>Therefore, when the time came for a young Keith to choose a university, many colleges showed interest in the young prodigy. However, it was Boston University that won Tkachuk’s heart as the university was located near his hometown.</p><p>Subsequently, the Massachusetts native showed his capabilities to the whole nation during his one year with the university.</p><p>In fact, Tkachuk’s form was so impressive that he made his international debut for the U.S even before Keith became a professional.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sergei Fedorov Bio: Net Worth, Salary, Wife, Career, Achievements Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>As a result, almost all the teams wanted to secure the wunderkind’s services after just one year with Boston University.</p><p>Thus, at the age of only 17, a young Keith decided to make himself eligible for the upcoming 1990 NHL SuperDraft.</p><h2>Keith Tkachuk: Career</h2><p>Tkachuk made his professional debut for the Winnipeg Jets after being drafted as the 19th overall pick in the 1990 NHL SuperDraft.</p><p>Subsequently, the 6-feet-2 left-wing stayed with the franchise for five years, helping them reach the playoffs three times.</p><p>During his time with the Jets, some memorable moments include the 12 game scoring streak from 9 March to 3 April 1993. Surprisingly, Tkachuk’s rookie season in the NHL&nbsp;made the feat even more incredible.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tkachuk-284.jpg></p><p>Consequently, the Winnipeg Jets handed then 20-year-old Keith with the captain’s armband as a sign of acknowledgments for his contributions.</p><p>Contrarily, at the start of the 1995-95 season, he became a restricted free agent.</p><p>Subsequently, Tkachuk decided to sign for Chicago Blackhawks after offering him a five-year contract worth <strong>$17 million.</strong></p><p>But, having been a restricted free agent, the Winnipeg Jets had the opportunity to match Chicago’s offer, and that is precisely what they did.</p><p>The Jets not only re-signed the left-winger but stripped him of the captaincy. The reason being, they felt Keith had broken their trust and efforts put on him by the organization.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tkachuk-285.jpg></p><p>Nevertheless, Tkachuk picked himself up and performed outstandingly for the Jets until their relocation to Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>Subsequently, the Jets re-named the Massachusetts native as the captain for the newly formed franchise, Phoenix Coyotes.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyson Fury Net Worth: Bio, Fight Purse, Business, Cars, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>And it was with the Coyotes that Keith had the best season of his career. To be more precise, the 6-feet-2 left winger scored 52 goals in the 1996-97 campaign, which led him to his first NHL All-Star appearance.</p><p>However, due to injuries and disagreements with the organization, the Winnipeg Jets decided to trade Keith to the St. Louis Blues in the summer of 2000, thus ending his nine years stay with the franchise.</p><p>In those nine years, the Massachusetts native became the second all-time top goalscorer with 323 goals and first in penalty minutes with 1508 minutes.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tkachuk-286.jpg></p><p>At the time, it seemed like Tkachuk’s best years were behind him when he got traded to the St. Louis Blues.</p><p>Contrarily, the 6-feet-2 left winger’s best season came during the 2000-01 season. To explain, Keith helped the Blues reach the Western Conference Finals, but unfortunately, they lost to the eventual champions, Colorado Avalanche.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Keith-Tkachuk-Signed-Autograph-239x300.jpg></p><p>After that, the Massachusetts native’s time with St. Louis based franchise was full of ups and downs. In fact, Tkachuk was even traded to the Atlanta Thrashers in 2007 due to injuries and weight issues.</p><p></p><p>But, his time with the Thrashers was short-lived as the Blues re-signed the 6-feet-2 left winger in the same season.</p><p>Subsequently, Keith stayed with St. Louis Blues until he retired from professional hockey in 2010, thus ending a near two-decade stay in the NHL.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tkachuk-287.jpg></p><p>Furthermore, during his 19 years of stay in the NHL, Tkachuk amassed incredible numbers worthy of being inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p><p>Precisely, the Massachusetts native has played in 1290 games scoring 566 goals, provided 566 assists, and managed a further 555 points.</p><h2>How old is Keith Tkachuk? Height & Body Measurements</h2><p>Having been born in the year 1972 makes Tkachuk’s age 47&nbsp;years at the moment. However, like most other professional athletes, Keith looks way younger than his age due to fitness and health. In fact, the 47-year-old looks like he can still play professionally with his two sons.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexa Grasso Bio: Career, Age, Height, Salary Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Furthermore, the Massachusetts native stands at a towering 6 feet 2 inches. Consequently, due to his long body frame, Tkachuk dominated his opponents, as suggested by his scoring records.</p><p>In fact, Keith became the first American-born player to lead the NHL in goals by scoring 52 times for the Phoenix Coyotes during the 1996-97 season.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Young-Keith-218x300.jpg></p><p>Similarly, the 6-feet-2 left-winger weighs 107 kg (235 lb) at the moment, which is a bit heavy for a man of his height.</p><p>However, considering Tkachuk’s sacrifices during his playing career, we guess that the Massachusetts-born player deserves to eat whatever he wants.</p><h2>Keith Tkachuk: Career Highlights and Awards</h2><ul><li>1991- All Hockey East Rookie Team</li><li>1995, 1998 – Second All-Star Team</li><li>1997,&nbsp;1998,&nbsp;1999, 2004<a title="NHL All-Star Game" href=#>,&nbsp;</a>2009 – All-Star Game</li><li>2012 – Hall of Fame</li></ul><h2>Keith Tkachuk Cap Friendly: Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>Currently, Keith has accrued an eye-watering net worth of <strong>$55 million</strong>, mainly through his career as a hockey player.</p><p>During his playing time, Tkachuk was one of the best and most famous players in the NHL.

But, following impressive performances for the Winnipeg Jets, Tkachuk gradually increased his salary every year.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Keith-Tkachuk-Bobblehead-169x300.jpg></p><p>In the year 1995-96, the 47-year-old earned his biggest paycheck at the time, <strong>$6 million</strong>.
