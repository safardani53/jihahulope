They wanna be [baby mama] number five, six, and seven, so.” Below is everything to know the rapper’s children, including their mothers.</p><h2>Reginae Carter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Born on November 29, 1998, Reginae is Lil Wayne’s daughter with ex-wife <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Toya Johnson</strong></a>, a reality TV personality, rapper, author, and businesswoman.
