When they met, Kendra was 18 years old, while the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>late publisher</a> was 78. She recalled the first time they spoke in her book,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sliding Into Home</a>, which was released in 2010. Hugh had called her to invite her to his 78th birthday party and asked her to be his girlfriend over the phone. In the book, Kendra revealed that it “wasn’t a physical attraction” that drew her to Hugh, but rather because was “cool.” She also wrote, “As you probably know, I became Hef’s girlfriend, moved into the Mansion full-time, and a year later began filming the hit show The Girls Next Door.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8qepZ2qkWLEqrjKoqWsp55itba%2FwZqlnWVkboZzfJRxZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
