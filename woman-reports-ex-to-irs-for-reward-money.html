Many people think that the IRS is the most hated organization in the world. And while this deeply-rooted ire towards the Internal Revenue Service can be quickly dismissed as a consequence of people not wanting to pay taxes, for many it has to do with the double standard in which the organization operates."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I'm spending his money daily while he's facing years in jail. The female rage is a powerful thing"</p><p>Ava has posted about separating men from their cash in more ways than one: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said in another TikTok video</a> that she has been "banned from every dating app imaginable for scamming men out of thousands of dollars"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for Ava's claim that she snitched on her ex and made a grip of money off of his unpaid taxes, the IRS indeed does have a "whistleblower office" which rewards folks by cutting a cost of the cash the agency can take from the snitched-upon-individual and then handed over to the tattletale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS' website dedicated</a> to this rat-reward program, the percentage of the collected funds awarded to the double-crosser ranges anywhere from 15%-30%, which is a sizable chunk of change.</p><p>This means that according to Ava's TikTok, the Internal Revenue Service was able to seize anywhere from approximately $333,333 to $666,666 from her ex. While handing over $100k of that doesn't seem like something a government agency would do the IRS probably offers such hefty cuts as they probably wouldn't have gotten any money had it not been for the snitch telling them where to look.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Numerous TikTokers who replied to Ava's post applauded her vengeance plot. One person wrote: "i don’t think i’ve ever admired anyone more than rn"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Someone else said that they were completely oblivious to the fact that the IRS was offering folks money for reporting individuals who are behind/late on their taxes: "THERES REWARD MONEY?! I did the same thing cause he did the same thing. I CAN GET PAID ?!"</p><p>Another person mentioned that seeing Ava's video pop up in their TikTok feed felt like a bit of kismet: "wild to have this show up on my fyp right after my partner of 7 years cheated on me and also has never paid taxes"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Even TikTokers, like this user, who aren't about tattling on other people's business approved of Ava's purported actions involving her ex: "I normally have a very firm 'no snitching' stance, HOWEVER..."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Would you make an alliance with the forces of darkness (the IRS) in order to exact revenge on a lover who hurt you? Do you believe someone is entitled to money because they were cheated on? Do you believe Ava was out of line?
