Grant‚Äôs Farm is the 281-acre ancestral home of the Busch family, named for Ulysses S. Grant who originally worked a portion of the land. Anheuser-Busch's headquarters is located in St. Louis so it only makes sense that the family farm would too.</p><p>It has been ranked as a top attraction nationwide by the U.S. Family Travel Guide Zagat Survey¬Æ and two-time winner of the TripAdvisor¬Æ Certificate of Excellence, the unique landmark combines history, heritage, and wildlife to create an unforgettable experience! Over the years, Grant‚Äôs Farm has grown and changed to keep up with the times but has continued to be a unique, one-of-a-kind attraction. Grant‚Äôs Farm has hosted celebrities and been home for wildlife and old-world tradition.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Busch Family farm is basically a tourist attraction.</h2><p>Grant's Farm is open to the public for free; however, there is a small parking fee that helps maintain the farm. The farm is home to such animals as buffalo, elephants, camels, kangaroos, donkeys, goats, peacocks, and the iconic Budweiser Clydesdales.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>In celebration of #WorldCamelDay, come visit Ed and Luke!

Grant in 1856. The structure was originally built on another part of the property and later relocated to Grant's Farm. It is actually the only remaining structure that was hand-built by a U.S. president prior to assuming office.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There was some drama over the ownership of the farm.</h2><p>In November 2015, the St. Louis Zoo agreed to purchase Grant's Farm for $30 million and use the land as a breeding facility for endangered animals, but one Busch heir and The Busch Family Brewed star, Billy Busch Sr., made a competing offer and wanted to keep the farm in the family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>There are bad jokes...and then there are DAD jokes. üòÇ Meet @billybusch7!

All of this drama would have made for great scenes on The Busch Family Brewed, right? If only the timing was right!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When was 'The Busch Family Brewed' filmed?</h2><p>Many are wondering when filming began for The Busch Family Brewed and how much time has passed since the show actually aired. While the exact timing of filming is unknown, it generally takes about 9 months to film a full season. Each episode takes between 5-8 days to film, then it goes into the editing process. For reality TV, they generally film the entire season before the show starts airing. It‚Äôs safe to say that the Busch family began filming as long as a year ago.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>The last place I would want to be cornered by my partners family is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by guns...just sayin'! üôÉ Catch up on the first two episodes of #BuschFamilyBrewed On Demand or on MTV.com.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The Busch Family Brewed</a> (@buschfamilybrewed) on Mar 7, 2020 at 8:01am PST</p></figure><p>The Busch Family Brewed airs Thursdays at 9/8c.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl8K0r8dmnZqlmaHGbrLAq6RmpJ%2BYrrW1zqc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
