“I mean, I never dated before so I didn’t have anything to compare it to, but I definitely think it’s harder than I thought,” Mowry, 45, exclusively told Us Weekly on Thursday, November 9, while promoting JCPenney’s “Penny Prepper” challenge. “But I am optimistic [and] I’m in the present."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m not thinking too far down the line. Everything is good.”</p><p class=p1>While Mowry is <a href=#>open to meeting someone new</a>, she doesn’t understand why so many fans are interested in getting an update on her love life. “I am choosing to [keep it quiet]. Y’all going to have to just guess and continue to guess,” she quipped. “I’m not saying anything.”</p><p class=p1>The <i>Sister, Sister </i>alum <a href=#>announced her split from Hardrict, 44, in October 2022</a> after 14 years of marriage. Mowry filed for divorce one week later, and <a href=#>the proceedings were finalized</a> in April. Mowry and Hardrict now share joint custody of son Cree, 12 and daughter Cairo, 5.</p><p class=p1>“It’s all about thinking about everything from not just your perspective, but the kids’ perspective as well,” she told <i>Us </i>of coparenting with Hardrict. “I feel like that’s where<a href=#> kids definitely become a priority</a> and focus on their peace, their joy, their happiness and what makes them feel at ease and feel comfortable and love. I’m really leaning on love and compassion. If you move through life, no matter what it is that you’re doing, through love and compassion, I truly believe that everything will fall into place the way that it’s supposed to.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Tia-Mowry-Explains-Why-She-s-Optimistic-About-Dating-After-Finalizing-Divorce-From-Cory-Hardrict.jpg><p class=p1>Cree and Cairo have remained Mowry’s No. 1 priority, but <a href=#>she has also been focused</a> on self-growth.</p><p class=p1>“Right now I really feel like I’m in my new chapter,” she told <i>Us </i>on Thursday. “I’m here, and that’s the other thing that I’ve learned too is I’m just more present. I’m not really thinking too much in the past. I’m not thinking too much [about] the future. I’m just all about now, which has given me joy.”</p><p class=p1>Mowry has also become <a href=#>more “present with my children,”</a> and that mindset will continue during the holiday season with a special trip to Thailand.</p><p class=p1>“This is the first time that I’ve ever been, and I’m really excited to be <a href=#>taking my children with me</a>,” Mowry gushed. “I think exposing them to different cultures is so incredibly important and just making memories with them. I chose Thailand because I personally feel that it’s going to be very healing just for me and I’m really, really excited about it.”</p><p class=p1>Mowry — whose <a href=#>festive traditions</a> also include <a href=#>matching pajamas and homemade cookies</a> — has joined forces with JCPenny’s “Make It Count” report of holiday hosting tips to launch the “Penny Prepper” challenge. In the social media challenge, holiday hosts will share their best festive tricks for under $300 and consumers can vote for their favorites.</p><p class=p1>“JCPenney has definitely been my playground during the holidays this season,” she told <i>Us</i>. “I’m what JCPenney would call the ‘penny prepper,’ meaning I love to prep ahead of time just so that I don’t get stressed out. And also, so I can enjoy the festivities with my family and my friends [during the party].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Mowry particularly loves that JCPenney offers “high quality” items for a reasonable price point. “It’s been a lot of fun,” she noted of the partnership.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoKliwaqtjKamsKqpYra0ec6pq6KlmajBqq%2BMmpmoraRisaLAyKeeZpmWqbKzecKoqbJlmJa%2Fpb7InKtmnJmrvLOvxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
