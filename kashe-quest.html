The genius baby was born with an exceptional memory. Her mother posted a lovely video of the child celebrating her first birthday on her Instagram account in July 2019.</p><p>Kashe Quest is three years old this year, but based on her activities, she appears to be twenty. The beautiful baby’s zodiac sign is Cancer, according to her birthdate. Cancer is a water sign ruled by the Moon. People born under this sign are highly imaginative, persuasive, emotional, loyal, and sympathetic.</p><p>After realizing the child’s worth, her mother began teaching Kashe at home using various teaching aids. Kashe’s parents claim that their ward can name all the elements on the periodic table, identify all 50 states by shape and location, speaks Spanish in addition to her native tongue English, and can decipher patterns. The youngster is stunning, with beautiful black eyes, curly brown hair, and an extremely attractive smile.</p><p>Kashe Quest is too young to manage her social media accounts, so her mother contains them.

To aid her daughter’s development, Sukhjit established The Modern Schoolhouse in South Pasadena, California, for infants aged six weeks to 5 years.</p><p>The preschool opened in October with 12 students. Sukhjit also owns ‘The Modern Mom and Baby,’ a store specializing in Baby, Toddler, Essentials, and Education. The products offered here are safe for children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kashe-Ques-1.jpg><h2>Kashe Quest Path To Intelligence</h2><p><strong>She</strong> was ahead of many other students her age when she uttered her first word, and from there, her abilities proliferated, and she was soon communicating in sentences of 5 or more words.

In an interview, Sukhjit stated, “Kashe Quest took an interest in sorting shapes as an infant, and by the time she was 16 months old, she could recognize words.”</p><p>Kashe’s parents took her to the pediatrician for her 18-month check-up, and it was noted there that she is one-of-a-kind. Sukhjit and Devon were astounded by the results of their pediatrician’s Mensa test and decided to consult with a psychologist who administered the Mensa test.</p><p>The IQ test results astounded everyone; the genius baby had an IQ of 146, while the average American has an IQ of 98, according to worlddata.info.</p><p>Kashe Quest was blessed with the best parents; as Sukhjit revealed in an interview, the biggest takeaway was that they wanted to make sure they were giving their child everything she needed in terms of development, natural curiosity, and disposition.</p><p>When Kashe became frustrated with a task, the couple began focusing on her progress and encouraging her by saying they were proud of her progress.
