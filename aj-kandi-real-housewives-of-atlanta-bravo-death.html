"Never in a thousand years did I think it was going to be the last time I heard his voice. He was taken way too soon.

It truly bothered him the way he has been portrayed in the media and actually it has bothered me too. A.J. was NOT a 'Scrub' like so many people like to blog and say. ... He did not need me for financial gain, nor did he use me to gain some type of celebrity.</p><p>"In all actuality, A.J. hated and was uncomfortable with being on camera," she added. "Off-camera, A.J. was very charismatic and a friend to many. He believed in God and always genuinely tried to do the right thing."<br></p><h2>Who was he engaged to?</h2><p>AJ was once set to marry Kandi Burruss, who stars in Bravo's Real Housewives of Atlanta.</p><p>The couple got engaged in January 2009, and the two shared custody of his twin daughters.</p><p>Their relationship was a topic of discussion on the show as <a href=#>Kandi's mother didn't approve of AJ</a>.</p><p>The two ended up calling it quits before his death.</p><p>During the 2009 RHOA reunion episode, Kandi broke down over her former loves death.</p><h2>What is Kandi Burruss's net worth?</h2><p>Kandi Burruss is a singer, songwriter, record producer, businesswoman, and television personality.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she's worth $30million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000573267932.jpg><p>She reportedly makes around $450,000 per season of RHOA, once the highest-paid Housewife on the show.</p><p>Burruss first shot to fame as a member of the 90s R&B group Xscape.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>The 44-year-old College Park then went on to have a lucrative songwriting and music producing career.</p><p>She's featured on RHOA <a href=#>since the second season in 2009</a>.</p><p>On January 15, 2013, Burruss announced via Twitter that she was engaged to Todd Tucker, a former line producer for The Real Housewives of Atlanta, whom she had been dating since 2011 while filming the fourth season.</p><p>The reality TV star was <a href=#>crowned the winner of season 3 of The Masked Singer earlier this year.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpYGqCeYKXaJijZZuWu6W1jKucmqRdnby2v8SwoK%2Bdo2K8p3nAraOapqSWeqO%2BwK%2BmZpyVlsGpew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
