"It was earlier in the season."</p><p>"And," Jennifer recalls. "Everything was good."</p><p>She quickly admits that something may have already been wrong in June’s life, adding: "or at least we thought."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>This is such a sweet photo, and Jennifer’s right about how well it illustrates June’s personality.</p><p>Sometimes, between the clownish moments and the drama, it can be too easy to forget that reality stars are real people.</p><p>"June and I may have had our differences in the past," Jennifer readily admits.</p><p>"But," she emphasizes. "I truly care about this woman and her family."</p><p>Part of June’s family is now, through Sugar Bear, part of Jennifer’s family, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jennifer then issues a plea for her followers to provide emotional and even spiritual support for June.</p><p>‘This has been a difficult time," Jennifer points out.</p><p>That is an understatement. A crack cocaine arrest and a failed intervention are just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>"And," she continues. "I ask that you keep Miss June in your prayers."</p><p>She adds several instances of the prayer emoji.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Jennifer, at the time of her posting, reminded her followers to watch the show.</p><p>She then asked a special favor of them, imploring fans to "(please be kind in the comments)."</p><p>Many fans abided by Jennifer’s heartfelt request.</p><p>"This was heartbreaking to watch," wrote one follower. "The silver lining being how amazing you look and how hard you worked."</p><p>Jennifer’s storyline was much more positive than June’s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Glad to see such a nice, fun photo of you 3 together & your kind words regarding June," praised another fan.</p><p>The comment continued: "Hoped you two were friends off screen – oh and Jennifer you looked absolutely fabulous last week with your shorter curly hair!"</p><p>"Jennifer you are kind hearted person," wrote another commenter.</p><p>That follower continued: "Set your difference asides and you didn’t judge her for what she is going through. Prayers for Mama June."</p><p>It sounds like June could use all of the good vibes that she can get.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>See, it’s not just that she was arrested for crack cocaine, or that Geno was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence.</p><p>June adamantly refused to go to any in-patient treatment, despite the pleas of her children who are afraid that she will literally die.</p><p>The reason, as Pumpkin Shannon explained, is actually very simple.</p><p>June is afraid that she can’t watch Geno Doak, her good-for-nothing boyfriend, if she’s in in-patient treatment.</p><p>She’s afraid that he’ll cheat on her, as he has allegedly been doing already. She’s afraid that she’ll lose him.</p><p>No man is worth dying over.</p><p>And a man whom you have to watch constantly to keep him in line? He’s not worth keeping.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>June Shannon: Living Out of Vile Hotel Rooms with Crazy BF Geno After Crack Arrest!?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WDcLbEp6WinpWneq2tzJtkmqubqHqnrc2sZK2nXaW%2FosWMn6arZZqqu6Z50qGYp6afo3qistOeqWaekZ65prCMoqVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
