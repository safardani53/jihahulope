She, on the other hand, has been outspoken about her depressive battles since her adolescence. In recent years, she has been an outspoken advocate for improved mental health care in the United Kingdom and beyond.</p><p>When Queen Elizabeth II awarded her an OBE in 2015 for services to mental health, she highlighted her efforts to increase awareness of the significance of adequate mental health treatment. Ruby disclosed in 2017 that she had been diagnosed with early-onset dementia, which generated widespread anxiety among her followers across the globe.&nbsp;Despite this diagnosis, Ruby continues active as a champion for better access to mental healthcare as well as a performer on stage and television programs such as ‘The Graham Norton Show.’</p><p>Despite the fact that she requires additional assistance owing to dementia-related memory loss, such as utilizing scripts rather than improvising, Ruby continues to do what she enjoys most: making people laugh!&nbsp;Ruby is still involved in lobbying via groups such as The Alzheimer’s Society UK.&nbsp;She routinely plays at places around the UK, often selling out whole theatres! Ruby obtained her OBE 10 years ago, in the year 2000.</p><h2>Did Ruby Wax have surgery?</h2><p>The truth is that Ruby Wax has not had any surgery in recent years, although she did have certain surgeries when she was younger. Ruby, for example, required nose surgery at the age of 18 owing to a deviated septum, which caused trouble breathing through one nostril while sleeping.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ruby-Wax-2.jpg alt="Ruby Wax" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This operation was effective, and it dramatically improved her physical appearance and sleep quality! Ruby also underwent Botox injections in 2008-2009 but has failed to do so since then, perhaps out of fear or because it was no longer required, given how young she still appears today!&nbsp;Despite reports to the contrary, Ruby Wax hasn’t gone under the knife in a long time, and there doesn’t appear to be much need for her to, considering how bright and healthy she looks even after all these decades in show business!</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Ruby Wax</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8br7Um7Bmr5Gteqq4y6ecrKtdlruleceemKWsmGLCsbDArZxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
