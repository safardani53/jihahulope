I can take myself dancing and I can hold my own hand. Yeah, I can love me better than you can.”</p><p class=p1>The Tennessee native also <a href=#>released a music video</a> for “Flowers” on Friday, in which she strutted around a mansion by herself.

And I really do and did love him very, very, very much and still do, always will.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>After their breakup, Cyrus was linked to <a href=#><strong>Kaitlynn Carter</strong></a> and<a href=#> <strong>Cody Simpson</strong></a> before moving on with drummer <a href=#><strong>Maxx Morando</strong></a> last year.
