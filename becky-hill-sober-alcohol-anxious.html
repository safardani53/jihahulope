I’ve never met any of them but I would love to. I know Brooklyn well but I’ve never met his mum.”</p><p>Yungblud is riding high after his third, self-titled album topped the charts in September.</p><p>Of his dreams for the next few years, he added: “I don’t care how many records I sell but I love playing stadiums.</p><p>“I’m not just per- forming music. It is a mindset, a culture, a movement. That is what I think is rare and beautiful about Yungblud.”</p><p>Next time he is round at the Beckhams’ house, I reckon he will just need to Holler a little louder.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>A Grande surprise</h2><p>RUPAUL’S Drag Race contestants wondered just what kind of doll he had on his arm – until its blue dress burst open to reveal <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> inside.</p><p>She took to the stage in a mannequin-style disguise with made-up wig head before breaking free to announce herself as a guest judge on the MTV show’s 15th series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/www-instagram-com-p-cnggbr7tnqs-787208351.jpg><p>Host Rupaul looked delighted with her stunt.</p><p>It was a nod to a similar reveal by previous show contestant Vivacious – to whom Ariana paid tribute by borrowing her catchphrase, “Mother has arrived!”</p><p>Posting a selfie on Instagram, the <a href=#>US</a> hitmaker wrote: “I hope you all loved the premiere.
