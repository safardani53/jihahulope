He offered a tryout for Ballygunge United to participate in the U-16 game after training hard for more than 6-7 years.

Many of his fans are interested in learning more about his lover and personal life. We were unable to find anything on his partner despite extensive searches on the internet and his social media accounts. He hasn’t shared any photos of himself with pals or a partner, which may imply that he’s dating someone.&nbsp;It is probable that he is now single and looking for the appropriate life companion. Ravi, on the other hand, is now focused on his work and aspires to be a member of the Indian cricket squad. Furthermore, we hope that he will soon reveal his relationship to his admirers.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipmq6ZYri2ucCrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
