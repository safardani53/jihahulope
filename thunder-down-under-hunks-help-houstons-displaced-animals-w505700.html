According to a press release from the performing group, the sizable donation came from proceeds of a show they performed at the House of Blues in Houston last week.
In addition to their monetary donation, the studs, who have had a 16-year-long residency at the Excalibur hotel in Las Vegas, volunteered their time and services to the Houston Humane Society’s shelter where the men bathed and walked rescue dogs and cats."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The performers are seen cuddling puppies and kittens, and spreading their lovable energy.</p><p>“This is something that really means a lot to us. I have four dogs, two cats and a tortoise, and every single one of the guys on this show has an animals themselves,” Marcus Deegan, <i>Thunder From Down Under’s</i> emcee explained. “It’s a small pinch, but everyone can donate to this massive cause. If anybody out there has a pet, know it’s not just an animal – it’s part of your family. So when these animals are suffering, it’s these people [from the Humane Society] that make their lives better.”</p><p>And while Hurricane Harvey has caused significant damage throughout the state of Texas, it’s still too early to know how many pets have been lost or displaced by the massive storm. According to <a href=#>CBS News</a>, approximately 600,000 animals were displaced or killed during 2005’s Hurricane Katrina.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To learn how you can help displaced animals in Houston, Texas, please visit <a href=#>houstonhumane.org</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoKWjsaa%2BjJ2msKZdqrulsdFmn66mm6h6qbHLqWShp6WowbC60maboqugoa6kscNmmKehnZa5tHnWbmdub2BlfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
