Based on the book of the same name by Patricia Highsmith, Deep Water is a psychological thriller centered around Vic, a husband who becomes a primary suspect in the disappearance in one of his wife's, Melinda's, lovers.</p><p>The movie is already garnering praise for its sumptuous imagery, which has left many viewers wondering where the movie was filmed. As it turns out, Deep Water shares some of its main on-screen locations with other chilling movies and TV shows. Here's everything you need to know before watching the thriller.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was 'Deep Water' filmed?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Water's IMDb</a>, the movie was filmed in a historic mansion called "Urbania" in the the Lower Garden District of New Orleans. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nola.com</a>, the iconic location, which is heavily featured in the movie, has a rich history and deep ties to the city.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>The 5,700-square-foot house is now occupied by Julie Simpson, a "serial renovator" who has undertaken the restoration of many historic properties in the city. She has restored a number of other homes with her life and business partner, Banks McClintock. Although the Simpson family plans to live there full-time after the renovations are complete, the home is sometimes available as a filming location.</p><p>Along with Deep Water, projects like <a href=#>American Horror Story</a>, Scream Queens, and 12 Years a Slave have all filmed at the mansion. "When I work on a house, I like to let the architecture speak for itself," Julie said. "I don’t like a lot of stuff everywhere because I feel as though it detracts from the building."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was 'Deep Water' pulled from its theater release?</h2><p>Deep Water was originally set for a nationwide theatrical release on Jan. 14, 2022 but was pulled because movies with more "adult fare" aren't performing well in theaters. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> reports that Steven Spielberg's West Side Story earned a measly $10.5 million for its opening, while <a href=#>Marvel's</a> <a href=#>No Way Home</a> saw a $135-155 million opening weekend. For now, Deep Water all be available to stream on <a href=#>Hulu</a> domestically, and on <a href=#>Amazon Prime</a> abroad.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Deep Water is director Adrian Lyne's first movie sine 2012's Unfaithful, which also deals with a husband finding out about his wife's affair. Adrian also directed one of the most iconic movies about having an affair that goes wrong: Fatal Attraction, starring Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in career-defining roles.</p><p>Deep Water premieres on Hulu on March 18, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKmvIywmK2domKzqrjMoqWgZZyksKLAyKilrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
