On The O.C., no location was more iconic than the Cohens’ pool house, but TikTok users have recently discovered a devastating fact — it wasn’t real.
In a recent video, TikTok user @youreanaccident pointed out that the pool house was a set, showing throwback photos from the studio and a tweet reading, “When you find out the pool house wasn’t real.”
Fellow TikTokers were absolutely horrified to learn that Ryan Atwood’s humble abode didn’t really come with a view of the Pacific Ocean."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That home was used in the backyard shots, while a different house down the street was used for the exterior shots of the Cohen domain.</p><p>The first home, however, didn’t have a pool house, so set designers constructed one on the property that they took down after shooting was over. The set inside the studio was then based on the real backyard, and the fake pool house was reconstructed indoors.</p><p>The O.C. series finale aired in 2007, but since the show started streaming via HBO Max in 2020, fans have been clamoring for a reboot or reunion. <strong><a href=#>Rachel Bilson</a></strong>, who played Summer Roberts, and <strong><a href=#>Melinda Clarke</a></strong>, who played Julie Cooper, <a href=#>also started their own rewatch podcast</a> called “Welcome to the OC, Bitches!”</p><p>Since they kicked off the show in May, the actresses have interviewed O.C. creator <strong>Josh Schwartz</strong> and stars <strong><a href=#>Tate Donovan</a></strong> (Jimmy Cooper), <strong><a href=#>Peter Gallagher</a></strong> (Sandy Cohen) and <strong><a href=#>Chris Carmack</a></strong> (Luke Ward).</p><p>In one episode, Bilson, 39, apologized to Donovan, 57, <a href=#>for the younger cast members’ behavior</a> on set. “I know some of us kids were little a–holes,” she told the actor. “And I hope I wasn’t as bad as it’s come off. I hope I wasn’t — because I really, you know, you get influenced, I’d say, by your surroundings. … So if I ever added to any of the a–hole-ness, I want to apologize on record.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Rocketman star previously made headlines in 2013 when he told Vulture that some of his fellow actors had “bad” attitudes.</p><p>“They just didn’t want to be doing the show anymore. It was pretty tough; they were very tough to work with,” he said. “I mean, one of them turned to me and said, ‘This show is ruining my film career,’ and he had never done a film before.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZupvKx51Kycq6tdp7KiuMiznGasmJp6sHnCZqeop5xitbDB0p5ksJmjYrOit8Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
