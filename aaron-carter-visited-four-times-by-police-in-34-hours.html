Aaron may have just said hostile things to his brother, as <a href=#>Aaron and Nick don’t get along so well</a>.</p><p>The fourth call came at 9:46pm last night.</p><p>The caller claimed that Aaron had threatened to kill himself, that he was no longer responding to text messages, and that he had "threatened" to take Xanax&nbsp;and Klonopin.</p><p>Alprazolam&nbsp;or clonazepam&nbsp;might have been just what Aaron needed and they might even be things that he’s been prescribed (benzodiazepines can work wonders when used as directed), but no one should take too much of any medication.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Aaron was at no point arrested or taken into police custody.</p><p>Welfare checks are just that — police show up and see if you seem okay or if anything seems to be amiss.</p><p>It sounds like Aaron had one friend or loved one — or perhaps more than one — very, very worried. Worried enough that they’d reach out to police and risk Aaron never forgiving them.</p><p>We hope that Aaron Carter is doing okay.
