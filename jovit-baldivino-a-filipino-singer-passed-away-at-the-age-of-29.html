Baldivino died only a few days after appearing on Family Feud Philippines.&nbsp;Hilario Baldivino, Baldivino’s father, said that he died as a result of stroke complications and claimed that although the family will not be able to recover from the loss anytime soon, they would always adore him. His wife also paid homage to him on social media, releasing a video and expressing her love for him.</p><h2>Jovit Baldivino died as a result of a stroke.</h2><p>According to his father Hilario, Jovit died as a consequence of complications from a moderate hemorrhagic stroke. He suffered another stroke last month but was able to recuperate after being admitted to the hospital.&nbsp;Jovit’s father made the announcement, stating that Jovit had a stroke while playing at a Christmas celebration in Batangas City. Jovit felt unwell after performing three songs, according to Hilario, and was immediately brought to the Jesus of Nazareth Hospital. He did, however, enter a coma.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jovit-Baldivino-3.jpg alt="Jovit Baldivino" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Following his hospitalization, singer Limuel Llanes requested that everyone pray for him on social media. He even requested for financial assistance and went on to say:</p><p>“He had a good procedure and was fighting for his life while in a coma.” I advocate for my close friend’s life extension on behalf of his family and loved ones.”</p><p>However, since Jovit’s medical history is presently unknown, it is hard to determine whether he has ever had any additional health problems.</p><p></p><h2>Jovit Baldivino was a well-known singer and actor.</h2><p>Jovit was born on October 16, 1993, and her first album, Faithfully, was released in July 2010 to great reviews. Baldivino won Pilipinas Got Talent the same year and went on to participate in other series such as 1DOL and ASAP. I’d Do Anything For Love, his second album, was published in 2011.&nbsp;Baldivino portrayed Brando in the ABS-CBN sitcom Growing Up and was named Promising Singer/Performer at the 42nd Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation Box Office Entertainment Awards, which were held in the Philippines.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jovit-Baldivino-4.jpg alt="Jovit Baldivino" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>His third album, OPM Greatest Hits Volume One, was published in 2012, while his fourth, Jukebox, was released in 2015.

Jovit competed in We Love OPM with Bugoy Drilon and Daddy D, and the group was declared the champion in the end. He was most recently seen in an episode of GMA Network’s Family Feud Philippines.</p><p>Jovit Baldivino’s wife Camille Ann Miguel and other family members survive him.
