“This is what killed Saget,” Stamos, 59, quipped while tearfully eating spicy wings on the show’s Thursday, July 20, episode. (Saget previously appeared in a November 2017 episode of the popular YouTube series.)
Following the dark joke, Stamos clarified Saget “would do that joke if he was alive to me,” adding, “He wouldn’t have waited a year and a half either."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(Saget previously appeared in a <a href=#>November 2017 episode</a> of the popular YouTube series.)</p><p>Following the dark joke, Stamos clarified Saget “would do that joke if he was alive to me,” adding, “He wouldn’t have waited a year and a half either. He would say the worst things.”</p><p>Stamos starred alongside Saget on the beloved sitcom <a href=#>Full House</a> from 1987 to 1995. Saget <a href=#>passed away at the age of 65</a> in January 2022 following a stand-up comedy performance in Florida. His <a href=#>cause of death</a> was later revealed to be blunt head trauma caused by <a href=#>an accidental fall</a> in his Ritz Carlton hotel room.</p><p>At the time of his former costar’s death, Stamos tweeted that he was <a href=#>“broken” and “gutted” by the news</a>. “I am in complete and utter shock,” he wrote. “I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby.”</p><p>Later that year, Stamos exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that Saget never knew “how loved he was,” adding, “I wish that you could sort of bring him back and sit him down and … you know, read everything, I’m sure he’s seeing everything. ‘Cause I can hear him complain sometimes if I’m very quiet from heaven. He’s like, ‘What, why did you say that, John?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/John-Stamos-Jokes-Full-House-Costar-Bob-Sagets-Hot-Ones-Episode-Is-What-Killed-Him1.jpg><p>Stamos continued to keep Saget’s memory alive during his Hot Ones appearance by recalling an embarrassing story about going to a strip club with Saget and <a href=#><strong>Dave Coulier</strong></a> during the early days of Full House.</p><p>“Bob was always very, like, ‘I’m too famous.’ I said, ‘It’s alright. Put a hat on or something. And don’t worry, I know the guys there. I’ll take care of this,’” Stamos shared. Though the trio attempted to remain low-key in the club, it didn’t take long for their presence to be known.</p><p>According to Stamos, an announcer stated, “‘And coming here live, look at this, the boys from Full House. Uncle Jesse, Joey and Danny! Give them a big round [of applause].’”</p><p>In addition to the funny memory, Stamos revealed that he wasn’t always a fan of being on Full House. After the show was pitched to him as <a href=#>Bosom Buddies</a> with “a couple of kids in the background,” he began to question why the casting process for the kid roles — played by <a href=#><strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jodie Sweetin</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mary-Kate</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ashley Olsen</strong></a> — was taking so long. He later realized why during one of the show’s first table reads.</p><p>“Jodie Sweetin, who plays Stephanie, reads her lines and people are dying laughing, I mean, screaming. I was like, ‘What’s happening here?’” he told Hot Ones host <a href=#><strong>Sean Evans</strong></a>. “They couldn’t even hear my lines, they were laughing so hard at her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/John-Stamos-Jokes-Full-House-Costar-Bob-Sagets-Hot-Ones-Episode-Is-What-Killed-Him2.jpg><p>After the table read, he called his agent and asked them to “get me the f—k off this show” — though his opinion of the series changed over time.</p><p>“I fought it a long time and then I finally said, ‘What am I doing? <a href=#>It’s a beautiful show</a> we built with sweetness and kindness,’” Stamos noted. “There was no central character on the show, is what I realized. The central character was love. We were the best representation of a loving family and not a normal family. And it was the new normal, was now an unconventional family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGooJ5iwLWtzKiqZqKfoLK0ecGomWarkZyytb%2BMoaatZZ%2BjsrR5xKmgrKeUmnqstculnJ1lmJ66cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
