“I love this refreshing cocktail because it really tastes like summer — it’s like a tropical vacation in a glass,” the Georgia resident, 55, revealed in the newest issue of Us Weekly. “It’s light, crisp and just an easy and delicious drink!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I moved up quite quickly. I was a manager at my branch after about four months,” she explained, adding, “I worked at Wendy’s for a short time as well. Somehow I was on the baked potato duty.”</p><p>Though Bailey’s specialty may involve potatoes, she’s long been a fan of cocktails.</p><p>“After a long day, I like to crack open one of my delicious, refreshing peach bellinis from Seagram’s Escapes, sit on my couch and watch a movie,” she told Us at the time.</p><p>Bailey loves Seagram’s so much that she included it in her Lemon Crush recipe. (She specifically uses Seagram’s Escapes Jamaican Me Happy for the pink lemonade-based beverage.) The cocktail also includes bright, refreshing fruits: lemon, strawberries and watermelon — making for light and fruity sips filled with all the colors of a summer sunset.</p><p>The instructions are just as straightforward as the ingredients: simply fill a pitcher with ice and stir in the Seagram’s, pink lemonade and vodka together with the fruit. (The watermelon slice is just for garnish.) Voilà! A summer drink for two is ready to serve.</p><p>For Bailey, the optimum way to enjoy the refreshment could be while she is relaxing with husband <strong>Mike Hill</strong>. The Bravo alum once surprised her beau, 51, with an impressive dinner spread after welcoming him home in March 2021.</p><p>“Welcome back, Mr. Hill. See the spread I laid out?” she wrote via her Instagram Story at the time, sharing a dining room table filled to the brim with grilled meat, a salad, avocado and rice, and plenty of vegetables, including Brussels sprouts and corn.</p><p>Whet an appetite — and thirst! — with Bailey’s Lemon Crush recipe below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Real-Housewives-of-Atlanta-Star-Cynthia-Bailey-Tickled-Pink-Cocktail-Drink-2.jpg><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><p>3 cups ice, or as much as it takes to fill your pitcher (plus more for serving).</p><p>1 bottle Seagram’s Escapes Jamaican Me Happy, chilled</p><p>2 oz vodka</p><p>¾ cup pink lemonade</p><p>1 lemon, sliced</p><p>¼ cup sliced strawberries</p><p>Watermelon slices, for garnish</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>1.
