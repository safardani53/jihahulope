Cyn revealed on Aug. 9 that she’s pregnant with their first child. “My biggest blessing,” she said while showing off her baby bump while posing in white lingerie. Cyn definitely knew how to pose for the camera.

She’s open with her sexuality</strong>. During her time on L&HH, Cyn was involved with <strong>Erica Mena</strong>. “I’ve like kissed girls before,” Cyn said while discussing her relationship during a 2014 appearance on Hot 97, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Madame Noire</a>. “I’ve never been in a relationship with a girl. She basically harassed me. I was pinned to the wall and I had no other f*cking choice.” Eric admitted that she did “put in a lot of man hours for her,” and that they had actually discussed marriage (which not legal in New York back then.) Sadly, their relationship fell apart due to Erica’s alleged infidelity. Erica would get engaged to <strong>Bow Wow</strong>, 30, in 2015, a year before Syn started dating Joe.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>3.

We should all be respected the same even if we have different body figures. … <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NU is not for the faint of heart</a>. It is for the confident and fearless woman ready to conquer her world. The confident and brave – women who aren’t afraid to feel comfortable in their own skin.
