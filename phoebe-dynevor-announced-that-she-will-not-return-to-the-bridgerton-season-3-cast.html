Phoebe Dynevor, the show’s heartthrob, has indicated that she will not be returning for the third season. Unfortunately, this happened just as the network was gearing up for a huge season. Daphne Bridgerton, played by Phoebe Dynevor, was one of the show’s most intriguing characters.</p><p>Phoebe’s role in the sitcom was Daphne Bridgerton, the fourth eldest child of the Bridgerton family. She was also the oldest child. Her role had matured dramatically over the previous two seasons, and fans were undoubtedly looking for much more from the talented actress. Phoebe told Screen Rant in an interview:</p><p>“Unfortunately not in season three, but perhaps in the future. But I’m simply thrilled to see Season 3 as a spectator.”</p><p>This is logical in the storyline, since Regé-Jean Page, who portrayed Daphne’s boyfriend and future husband Simon Basset, departed the program after the first season and has no plans to return.

Not only did her character have a lengthy past, but she was also one of the most important components of Bridgerton season 2’s continuing plot.&nbsp;While fans had hoped for much more from the character, the tale will tragically come to an end for the time being. Phoebe Dynevor, on the other hand, did not clearly indicate that she would never return to the program.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Phoebe-Dynevor-1.jpg alt="Phoebe Dynevor" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Daphne has the title of Duchess of Hastings and has been planning the ideal wedding for years. She eventually married Simon Basset after meeting him at Lady Danbury’s ball while attempting to avoid Nigel Berbrooke’s attention. Their love story was a significant component of the first season of the program, laying the groundwork for the subsequent stories.&nbsp;The second season focused on a new pair, Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey) and Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley). Another fresh pair will become the highlight of the well-decorated Bridgerton in the forthcoming third season.</p><p>The third season will reportedly feature Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan). According to the showrunners, all of the other characters will return for the third season.</p><p>Nicola Coughlan, a Netflix panelist, revealed the announcement with the showrunners. She stated:</p><p>“I’ve been keeping it secret since the second season began two weeks ago…If you saw Penelope adoring this guy for another season, you’ll be like, ‘Get it together, Penelope!’ Come on, get over it, and move on… I believe people will get fascinated. I believe book lovers will be pleased.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Phoebe-Dynevor-2.jpg alt="Phoebe Dynevor" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bridgerton features a large ensemble cast that includes several well-known actors.
