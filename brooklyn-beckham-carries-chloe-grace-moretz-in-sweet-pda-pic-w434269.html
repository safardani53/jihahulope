Brooklyn Beckham carries girlfriend Chloë Grace Moretz in a sweet black-and-white PDA photo he shared with fans via Instagram on Thursday, August 11.
“Keeping her safe,” the 17-year-old heartthrob captioned the snapshot, along with a red heart emoji. In the image, Beckham has his back to the camera as he lifts Moretz, 19, up off the floor, her legs wrapped around his waist.
Earlier in the day, Moretz caused a rumble online after posting a photo of herself lying — apparently topless — on the beach with her back to the camera."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The </span><i>Kick-Ass </i><span>star gave photo credit to her beau. </span><b><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></b><span>’s fans were quick to point out the irony of the actress posting the sultry image just months after she criticized the reality star for her nude selfie, albeit a much more explicit one.</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>“I truly hope you realize how important setting goals are for young women, teaching them we have so much more to offer than just our bodies,” several commenters reposted from Moretz’s original tweet in March.</span></p><p><span>The actress’ fans quickly came to her defense, however. “Just ignore all the immature people. People can be so stupid, overreacted,” one commenter wrote.</span></p><p><span>Beckham, meanwhile, chose to go with a </span><a href=#>controversy-free photo</a><span> from the couple’s beach day, opting for a black-and-white shot of Moretz posing in front of the sea clad in a white button-down shirt over a bikini.</span></p><p>The cute couple first confirmed their relationship in May, when Moretz posted a photo of <b><a href=#>David</a></b> and <b><a href=#>Victoria Beckham</a></b>’s son kissing her on the head. In her June 2016 <i>Glamour</i> cover story, the <i>Carrie</i> actress explained why she had kept their relationship status under wraps for so long.</p><p><span>"Because it’s no one’s business," the former child star said. "These moments are supposed to be so personal and special — you’re building a foundation with someone or just having fun and going on a date. No one needs to know about that, and I hate to see that stuff broadcast on TV."</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqp%2BkuK3FzWaZnpubna6uecKaqauhlah6pLTLqJxmn6KWsKZ5zKipnqyqYravedKwnJ6sXaWxonnPoppmr2RogXOCmGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
