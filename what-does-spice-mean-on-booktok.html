The term is slang used in place of erotica, especially within romance novels but not limited to them. Some users have even taken to ranking books out of 5 "peppers" to rate the spiciness scale for those who are interested in reading something more hot and heavy than the typical fare.</p><p>However, it should be noted that the definition of "spice" varies. The general consensus is that anything "spicy" means it contains explicit sexual content, but readers will have to decide for themselves what levels of "spice" they're interested in.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok/@wannabe.bookworm</span></figure><p>Shockingly, not all popular books on BookTok containing spice are contemporary romances.
