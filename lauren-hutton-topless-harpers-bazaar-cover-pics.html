One included her posing in a light green coat as her hair was up and she accessorized with different necklaces, including one that appeared to be a green-blue stone. Another showed her posing in a white blazer that was buttoned and black pants as her hair was down and she had her hands in her pockets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Lauren-Hutton-Harpers-Bazaar-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Lauren’s epic new photos, which was for the May beauty issue of Harper’s Bazaar, come six decades into her successful modeling career. In addition to doing what she does best (posing for a camera), the beloved star gave an interview to the magazine and talked about her beauty routine, including her skincare routine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I don’t spend a lot of time on skin care. I’m usually in a rush to get to bed and make love or read,” she told the outlet while adding that she’s currently reading Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>“The only beauty ritual I have is washing my face with soap and water. It’s horrifying,” she continued. “Then I’ll put on the StriVectin S.T.A.R. Light Retinol Night Oil. It does really good things for your skin. I also have an aloe plant. I cut the leaves open, and I put it all over my face and décolletage.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I put castor oil in my hair too,” she added. ‘It’s from a beautiful bean. I use one from Briogeo. I just put it on my fingertips and rub it all over my scalp, and it makes my hair a little less dry and nasty.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>It’s clear to see that Lauren’s beauty rituals are working and helping her to embrace her natural radiant self!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5FuZqWZpaeyr3nHrqutp55iwbC8y56qrGWYlr%2BxsdGsZJuZqpaus3nCqK2eql2ltqS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
