That might be unfair — even though Wendy Williams makes her living by gleefully relishing in the misfortunes of others. And she’s made a number of enemies along the way.
But … does Chris Brown, of all people, have any room to talk?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We sincerely hope that she’ll be able to use those meager funds to keep the lights on for a few weeks)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The reason for this doctor-instructed break from making cruel jabs at suffering celebrities and concocting wild theories about the motives behind new romances and breakups?</p><p>She suffers from both Graves Disease and hyperthyroidism. (Graves Disease being the most frequent cause for hyperthyroidism)</p><p>Symptoms can include&nbsp;nervousness, irritability, increased perspiration, a racing heartrate, hand tremors, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, thinning of the skin, fine brittle hair, and muscular weakness.</p><p>Wendy has experienced&nbsp;pressure behind her eyes and irritability along with trouble sleeping. Naturally, she may not have divulged all of her symptoms.</p><p>Some can’t help but wonder if this condition played a roll in her <a href=#>scary collapse on live television</a>.</p><p>Obviously, we wish Wendy Williams the best.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As inexcusable as some of Wendy’s statements have been — she’s declared that she’s <a href=#>sick of the #MeToo movement</a>, among many other things — there are much worse celebrities out there.</p><p>Speaking of whom … <a href=#>Chris Brown has some</a> thoughts on Wendy Williams’ health condition, according to HollywoodLife‘s source.</p><p>"Chris feels bad Wendy is suffering an illness, but he can’t help but think bad karma is to blame for her poor health."</p><p>Of all of the people in this world to believe that a person’s bad actions lead to cosmic consequences … you’d think that Chris Brown would not be among them.</p><p>You know, because of the very famous domestic violence thing. Upon Rihanna. <a href=#>Upon&nbsp;Kerrueche Tran</a>. And, let’s face it, many believe that Chris Brown may have a long list of victims.</p><p>Yet he reportedly believes that Wendy has earned this illness flair-up by, get this, judging him.</p><p>"Chris has been the target of Wendy’s criticism and judgment many times over the years so he has a hard time feeling too bad that she will be off the air for a few weeks."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Chris is a big believer in the energy in the universe and he thinks cosmic karma may be partly to blame for Wendy’s problems."</p><p>Many people have beliefs like that. We’d imagine that most of them might mold their actions accordingly.</p><p>"Chris feels that it’s because Wendy spends so much time dissing him, and others, that she has gotten so sick."</p><p>Victim complex much?</p><p>"Chris thinks that when she recovers, Wendy will think twice before she continues to bully people on her TV show."</p><p>That’s her whole brand, though.</p><p>"Chris is hoping her struggles with her health will make her a nicer person on the other side."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Honestly? The idea of Chris Brown so totally lacking moral clarity and self-awareness shouldn’t surprise me, but it’s kind of blowing my mind right now.</p><p>If he believes that people who say unkind things on television deserve illness, what does he think that Wendy Williams would deserve if she, to picka&nbsp; random example, made a habit of beating the crap out of young women she claimed to love?</p><p>We joke, but it may be that he truly doesn’t believe that he’s done anything "that bad." That’s a standard attitude for domestic abusers and other monsters.</p><p>Wendy Williams is not kind, but she’s not a monster.</p><p>She doesn’t deserve her illness. Criticism, sure. Not a chronic ailment.</p><p>And Chris Brown, who has never gotten what he deserves in his life, has no high ground against Wendy Williams or anyone else.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>19 Times Wendy Williams Has Totally Sucked as a Person</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2V%2FcK%2FHq6CsZZKnvLi6jLCcp5ypYsSquMuimKarXZmytLHRr5ysZaSkeqOxjKygnKNf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
