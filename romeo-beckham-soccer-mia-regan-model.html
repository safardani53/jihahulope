But when Romeo Beckham jogged onto the pitch at AS Monaco’s Training Centre yesterday some of his old man’s sparkle was there to see.
Brentford B team’s 4-1 victory over AS Monaco’s Groupe Elite is the second time in a week that Posh and Becks’ second born has shown he is very much a chip off the old block.
Last week, again after starting on the bench, the 20 year-old helped his team to a 3-2 win over non-league Erith & Belvedere."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While his love of sport is clear to see, Romeo’s also inherited his mum’s passion for fashion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NINTCHDBPICT000787842335-1.jpg><p>He’s also been lucky in the looks department getting the best bits of his parents — combining David’s smouldering eyes, height and lean physique and Victoria’s high cheekbones and infamous pout.</p><p>At the age of 12, Romeo was picked to front a global campaign for Burberry, as well as appearing on the <a href=#>covers of GQ</a> and Vogue magazines.</p><p>But, in 2020, he returned to his first love of football. Romeo’s U-turn saw supportive dad David bulldoze a £30k tennis court at their <a href=#>Cotswolds home</a> and replace it with a five-a-side football pitch.</p><p>He joined his dad’s Major League Soccer club <a href=#>Inter Miami</a> in <a href=#>Florida</a>, where he had been playing for the reserves.</p><p>He has been on loan with Brentford since the beginning of this year. But his debut last week was overshadowed by his famous dad’s attendance.</p><p>David was forced to jump a fence to escape the crowds after fans recognised him. Becks was just 17 when he made his debut for <a href=#>Manchester United</a> before going on to have a glittering career and captain England.</p><p>The comparisons will be inevitable for Romeo, but Brentford boss <a href=#>Thomas Frank</a> has urged people to treat the youngster as a player in his own right.</p><p>He said: “Romeo’s a very good player, of course he has a name that is pretty worldwide, and big. For Romeo, he is himself, but he of course has a big name. You can’t compare (father and son).”</p><p>He added: “He is here for a reason, because we think he is a good player.”</p><p>He already has footballer-style image deals in the bag. In 2021, Romeo signed a sponsorship deal reported to be worth <a href=#>£1.2million to be the face of Puma</a>.</p><p>And with his football career is on the rise, more endorsement deals are expected to roll in.</p><p>It also seems Romeo can add ‘peacemaker’ to his CV as he is said to have slipped into the role of mediator in a bid to heal an <a href=#>alleged rift</a> between his mum and big brother Brooklyn’s wife, <a href=#>Nicola Peltz</a>, 28.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cruz-beckham-harper-beckham-david-771802440.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/eroteme-ltd-claim-copyright-image-789399930.jpg><h2>Lavish ceremony</h2><p>The Beckhams have been dogged by rumours of a family feud — said to have started over the <a href=#>American actress’s choice of wedding dress</a>.</p><p>Nicola, who tied the knot with <a href=#>Brooklyn in a lavish ceremony</a> last April, claimed Posh had offered to design one and did not even call her to say she could not complete it in time for her big day.</p><p>But insiders claimed Victoria, 48, never promised to make the dress. Romeo is said to have been Victoria’s rock.</p><p>He showed his support last year by posting a picture taken after her Paris Fashion Week debut with the caption “Love u mum.”</p><p>Everyone knows that if you date a Beckham boy, it’s imperative you get on with the whole clan, particularly matriarch Victoria.</p><p>Luckily for Romeo, Mia already has the Posh Spice seal of approval. The young fashionista and influencer is said to get on famously with his mum and often models clothes from Victoria’s fashion line.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/romeo-beckham-smiles-signing-premier-787824607-2.jpg><p>Mia has even posted a photo of herself lying on the beach in a bikini with the word ‘POSH’ written on her bum cheeks to promote her future mother-in-law’s make-up range, which is named after ­Victoria’s <a href=#>Spice Girls</a> alter ego.</p><p>Victoria clearly appreciated Mia’s efforts, commenting with a string of crying-with-laughter emojis underneath the photo.</p><p>Mia was snapped sitting in prime position next to Posh in the front row of London Fashion Week last year and the pair collaborated on a new denim collection.</p><p>Mia, from Chippenham, Wilts, signed for top modelling agency Storm Models when she was 12.</p><p>In true Gen-Z fashion, Romeo and Mia broke the news they were a couple by becoming <a href=#>Instagram</a> official in 2019.</p><p>The young couple split in July last year — with the distance and their hectic work schedules said to be to blame — but confirmed they were back together in November when Romeo shared a photo of Mia on his Instagram to celebrate her birthday.</p><p>The stylish pair often post sweet pictures of themselves hanging out at the Beckhams’ Cotswolds home or larking about in the Lake District on a recent glamping trip and have racked up an army of fans on social media.</p><p>Romeo has even shown his commitment, in true Beckham style, by getting an “I love you” tattoo after rekindling his romance with Mia.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>The Beckham boys are known for marrying young — both David and Brooklyn were just 23 — so wedding bells could be on the cards.</p><p>Move over Posh and Becks — the next generation is ready to take your crown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9yfJdya2xrX6e8rrHOZpmem5udrq550qianJ2iYrqqrYyrnKCZnmK6sLDEpWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
