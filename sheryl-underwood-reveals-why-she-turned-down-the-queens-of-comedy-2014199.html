Rarely would we hear someone talking about us and saying what they truly feel about us.” She added: “I was bruised, but I wasn’t broken.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=336 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="sheryl underwood" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Queens of Comedy was a spin-off of the 2000 movie The Original Kings of Comedy.
