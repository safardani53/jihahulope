Since then, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>musician</a> has been hard at work in honing his craft and building a fan base.

He then taught himself how to make music and eventually worked with a vocal coach to improve.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“TikTok has played the biggest role in my music career. It started as a fun thing,” David explained to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>Paper</i></a> magazine in 2023. “I definitely had not planned to market my music. I did encouraging-type content at first and after writing ‘Miserable Man,’ I decided to just leak the song on the platform. I didn’t expect that the next day I’d wake up to a couple hundred thousand likes. Many people told me it would just be a one-hit wonder. But not even a few weeks later “Mr. Forgettable” did the same thing. At that point, I knew that TikTok would be a powerful tool to be able to connect with new people.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/david-kushner-ss-embed.jpg><h2>David’s Music Is Inspired By His Faith in Christianity<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Poptized</a> in 2023, David opened up about how his faith influenced his songwriting.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I have an amazing girlfriend, and me and her are both Christian, and she’s like a big rock in my life and foundation, and I have my parents who believe and, yeah, a lot of people in my close family,” he explained. “I do have a lot of artist friends, I mean, not a lot. Most of my artist friends do not share my faith with me, but I have a lot of friends, one of my roommates because I’m moving to L.A. this year, and he’s my best friend in the industry and a strong Christian. It’s really hard because there is a lot you can attain by kind of putting that down and kind of stop believing, as straightforward to make it, but it’s very, very hard, and it’s only going to get harder.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>His Song ‘Mr. Forgettable’ Is From an Alzheimer’s Patient’s Perspective</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>David also told Poptized how he crafted his song “Mr. Forgettable,” noting, “I would just try and write something significant, and when that does happen, I kind of come up with the storyline from that one little thing. Like ‘Mr. Forgettable’ — I wrote the chorus for it and I automatically knew it was going to be about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Alzheimer’s</a>.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>David’s Music Is Famous in Several Countries <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>After going viral on TikTok, David’s music reached No. 11 on the charts in Norway and No. 19 in Ireland.
