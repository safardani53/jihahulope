Every single one is a tenner or less, and many can be picked up from the supermarket while you're doing the weekly shop...</p><h2>Priceless presents - that won't cost a penny</h2><p>Firstly, remember as much as you appreciate your kid's teacher, you shouldn't feel pressured to spend huge amounts to thank them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/53ff231a-471e-446a-b3c3-d29a261ddb6a.jpg><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE MONEY SAVING TIPS">READ MORE MONEY SAVING TIPS</h2><p>George says: "Remember, teachers love gifts that cost nothing but time.&nbsp;</p><p>"The teachers and nursery workers we asked confirmed that a genuinely heartfelt handwritten card (grab one for as little as <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">£1.29 from B&M</a>) of thanks is possibly the best gift they could receive!</p><p>"One teacher we asked said she asks families to give cut flowers from their gardens if they want to give something, which she then ties into a bouquet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593273.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>"It costs nothing but is very personal and special.</p><p>"You could also email your thanks to the headteacher.</p><p>"Taking time to show your appreciation for your child’s teacher to their boss can mean a great deal."</p><h2>Say it with stationery</h2><p>If you do want to buy something, it really doesn't need to cost the earth, and who doesn't love to start a new year or term with some new stationery to get organised?</p><p>And if you're a teacher, stationery is an especially thoughtful and practical gift.</p><p>George says: "With so many dates to keep track of, this <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Wild Style desk planner</a> will keep teachers on track, priced £1.99 from the Card Factory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593271.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593176.jpg><p>"Alternatively, these <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">bright and bee-utiful notebooks</a>, a set of three from Tesco for £4, are also always handy for lesson planning.</p><p>"Something like this '<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">terrific teacher' glasses case</a>, £2.99 from the Card Factory, is also a sweet and practical gift for a teacher - perfect for keeping glasses or sunglasses safe.</p><p>"Additionally, nursery staff, childminders, and teachers carry a lot of things around with them.</p><p>"Remind them of how amazing they are with this <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">'awesome teacher' playful tote</a>, just £6.99 from giftdelivery.co.uk."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593074.jpg><h2>Personalised presents</h2><p>To add another level of thoughtfulness, you could also consider personalising their gift if you have the time.</p><p>It's a tiny detail that can instantly make a gift look more expensive.</p><p>George says: "For example, you could add their name to a special gift they will use daily, like this <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">personalised pencil notebook</a>, £4.99 from the Card Factory.</p><p>"A <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">personalised teacher print</a>, like this one currently on sale and priced £7.96 from Not On The High Street is thoughtful, personalised and something to keep in their office at home or school."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593165.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593170.jpg><h2>Say thanks with self care</h2><p>Another option is to buy a little something they can enjoy when term ends and they can relax at home.</p><p>George says: "There are plenty of candles in the supermarkets right now that look and smell much more expensive than they cost.</p><p>"For example, this <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Wilko mandarin and ginger glass candle</a> costs just £5.</p><p>"This <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">chic face candle</a> from B&M, £4, is very on-trend and looks a lot more expensive than it is.</p><p>"Also, all that talking can give teachers’ dry lips, so a natural lip balm set can be handy, and easily kept in their drawers at school.</p><p>"The <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Natural Extracts lip balm collection</a> is £4 for four from Tesco."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593180.jpg> <img

term</h2><p>Nothing says 'end of term' like a glass of bubbly.</p><p>George says: "This <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">prosecco and truffles set</a>, £5 from Tesco, is a luxurious treat teachers and nursery staff can enjoy to toast the term.</p><p>"After-work drinks could become even more stylish, by gifting <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">iridescent wine glasses</a> like this one from B&M, just £2.50.</p><p>"Or, you also can’t go wrong with a box of their favourite chocolates.</p><p>"A pack of <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Heroes is on offer at £2 in Morrisons</a>, until 27 July."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593277.jpg><h2>Handy homeware</h2><p>Offices, desks and gardens always look better with plants or flowers on them, or a nice vase.</p><p>George says: "This stylish <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">blue and white patterned vase</a> from Tesco, £6, looks a lot more expensive than it is.</p><p>"Fill it with cut flowers from your garden for an extra personal touch.</p><p>"Alternatively, this <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">mixed herbs selection box</a>, currently on sale at £10 from Asda, contains a collection of quick-growing and popular herbs including basil, coriander, parsley, and rocket, and is perfect for a small space or windowsill gardening.</p><p>"Additionally, these <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">'thank you' wildflower seeds in a matchbox</a>, currently on sale at £2.50 from Not On The High Street, are such a unique and thoughtful gift that will keep on giving when sown in their gardens."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593157.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000743593175.jpg><h2>Token gift</h2><p>If you'd rather get something you know they will definitely use, a voucher could be the way to go.</p><p>George says: "It may seem a little impersonal, but teachers and nursery workers can use them to buy what they really want and be reminded of the class that helped purchase them.</p><p>"Vouchers for afternoon tea, spa treatments, local restaurants, their favourite football or rugby team tickets and independent shops go down well!"</p><h2>Don't 'mug' them off</h2><p>While any gift is bound to be gratefully received, there are a few things that might be worth avoiding.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>George says: "When it comes to items such as perfume or jewellery, unless you know their taste, choose a voucher instead of a specific design or brand.</p><p>"Also, teachers seem inundated with mugs and water bottles, so perhaps one gift to avoid."</p><img
