But the biggest diss she’s received actually came just a few days before this year’s competition. “How does it feel to be so much… larger than the other delegates?” a journalist actually asked her during a press conference on Jan. 26. OMG, what? That’s exactly the reaction that backstage host <strong>Ashley Graham</strong>, 28, had to that horrible inquiry!</p><h3><a class=pmclinkcontent-post href=# rel=noopener>Miss Universe 2016 Evening Gowns</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-2>Ashley met up with Siera as she was coming backstage between segments at the pageant, held at the Mall of Asia Arena in the Philippines on Jan. 29, to chat with the beauty about the horrible comments she has had to endure during her pageant career. Ashley was not shy about questioning Siera, as she revealed that she herself had dealt with the same issue and very much empathized with the contestant. Siera was definitely grateful that Ashley had her back, but what the two bonded over was their ability to brush off those haters!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>WATCH: Sagot ni Ms. Canada sa "body shaming" comment ni 1969 Miss Universe Gloria Diaz <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@dzIQ990</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/z9jYzvxKFQ</a></p>— Angellic Jordan (@AngellicJordan) <a href=#>January 29, 2017</a><p id=content-paragraph-3>“My hope and my dream is that women of all shapes and all sizes and clearly we have so many different ethnicity that are in Miss Universe right now are able to compete and able to win and not have anybody have to talk about their weight because that is the most ridiculous thing,” the backstage host said to press earlier in the day at a red carpet event.&nbsp;Way to champion deep self-esteem!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/thisguymarc/status/825870760300335104</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>WE ARE WOMEN… FOCUS ON WHAT YOU LOVE ABOUT YOURSELF.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>YESSSS MISS CANADA.
