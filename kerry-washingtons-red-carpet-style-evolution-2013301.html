The award-winning actress played one of the chicest women to ever grace television: Olivia Pope. Her TV wardrobe redefined boss-lady style as she dressed up with luxe, polished neutrals that inspired a generation of women to reimagine their workwear. It comes as no surprise that Washington’s fashion is just as fierce and trendsetting IRL, too.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When she launched her Scandal-inspired collection with The Limited back in 2014, the actress shared that she enjoys working with different designers to create a variety of looks for different occasions.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Personally, I have tons of favorite designers. I don’t gravitate toward any one designer because I think of fashion as the costume of the everyday woman,” she told <a href=#>WWD</a> in June 2014. “The Armani house was one of the first ones to dress me. Jason Wu is a dear friend of mine, as is Tory Burch. I am a big fan of Alexander Wang.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Washington’s style consists of everything from shimmering gowns and colorful frocks to sweet minis and whimsical midis. The perennial best dressed-list favorite regularly plays with proportion and pattern and ensures she has an equally on-point hair and makeup look to match.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>One of her most talked about looks was the Tory Burch getup she sported to the <a href=#>2022 Met Gala</a>. The School for Good and Evil star’s black sheer gown included a strappy bodice, elegant train, matching gloves and thigh-high slit. The brunette beauty added sparkle to the ensemble with a breathtaking diamond choker and stud earrings.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For glam, Washington rocked nude eyeshadow shades, long lashes and glossy lips. Her locks were styled in a middle part and slicked back updo.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The <a href=#>Save the Last Dance</a> actress also sported a Tory Burch number to the <a href=#>2019 Met Gala</a>. The peachy ensemble featured a poofy ruffled skirt with “negativity is noise” written across it. She added a tucked-in white tank to the look and wore pink eyeshadow and lips. Her hair was cut in short bangs and she added even more drama with a beaded headpiece laying on top of her strands.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to take a trip down memory lane and see Washington’s best looks:</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKnqmrsV2srrS0yKeeraeeqHqzscNmmpqqoJrBbr%2FTsqOeZZWrvK3B06Kmp2ViZX50f49qZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
