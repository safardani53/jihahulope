According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, his earnings came from Tevin’s singing and acting projects. Per several sources, he landed his big break at the age of 12 when a family friend recorded him singing one of legendary jazz singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bobbi Humphrey</a>’s songs at a Manhattan showcase. The tape eventually caught music manager Benny Medina’s attention, and he flew to Tevin’s hometown and signed him to <a href=#>Quincy Jones</a>’ music label, Qwest.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Benny then moved Tevin to Los Angeles, and they immediately began working on his career. In 1990, Tevin released his first single, “Round and Round,” which reached No. 3 on the R&B charts. Around the same time, he gained recognition for his roles in Prince’s film Graffiti Bridge and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Fresh Prince fans will remember Tevin playing Ashley’s (Tatyana Ali) celebrity crush, “Little T.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Tevin continued putting out albums throughout the early 1990s.

In 1993, he introduced his “grown folks music” sound on his second studio album, “I’m Ready.” The album featured “Can We Talk,” which earned him three Grammy nominations.

However, he kept his real-life sexuality away from his fans for decades. While Tevin declared on People Magazine’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE Every Day podcast</a> that he "didn't hide" anything about himself during his fame, he chose not to come out as gay in the 1990s, stating, "You just couldn't be [gay] back then."</p><p>Despite not coming out as gay to the world, Tevin said he came out to family and friends at “about 19 or 20,” when his music career was declining. Then, he stepped away from music and booked a role in Hairspray on Broadway as Seaweed J. Stubbs in 2004. Tevin credited his time in the show for making him more comfortable living his truth.</p><p>"Being around people who were like me, LGBTQ+ people that were living normal lives and had partners — I had never seen that. That was a great time in my life," Tevin recalled.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While some fans have speculated on Tevin’s sexuality since the early years of his career, the singer has maintained his privacy for years.

After one user mentioned Tevin among other R&B singers who are rumored to have been gay, Tevin casually responded with “Tevin is…” adding a rainbow flag emoji before deleting the post.</p><p>Many fans felt Tevin’s tweet was him coming out, which he denies. The singer told People he isn’t concerned about the public’s opinions and said, "I love my fans, but what they think about my sexuality is of no importance to me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbK3tc1mmpqloJeyrbiMp5ytZaekv7W0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
