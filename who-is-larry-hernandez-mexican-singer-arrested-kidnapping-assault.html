Larry is a remarkable musician, and as these things often happen, he had his own reality show following his and his family’s lives to satiate his adoring fans.

He was the star of his own reality show, Larrymania&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Larry is a remarkable musician, and as these things often happen, he had his own reality show following his and his family’s lives to satiate his adoring fans.

He recorded his most famous album in a day&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“16 Narco Corridos” is&nbsp;Larry’s contemporary masterpiece, taking the no. 4 spot on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart and securing him a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>record contract</a>. More impressive, he wrote the entire album singlehandedly, and recorded it in a day. He’s gone on to have&nbsp;three top five albums on the Regional Mexican Albums chart, hitting #1 with&nbsp;“En Vivo Desde Culiacan” and “Larrymania.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>3. Music is a family business</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Larry found his love of music through his family; his grandfather and cousins are all well-established musicians. As a child, he would show his songs to his uncles and cousins, and they would give him pointers about the lyrics and melody. He’s not just a singer; he also plays the accordion and drums.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>4. He’s come under scrutiny&nbsp;for his controversial “narcos corridos”</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>A corrido is a popular style of narrative ballad that tells the story of oppression, history, and the plight of the lower classes. Larry sings a subgenre called narcos-corridos, which focuses on illegal activities, especially drug trafficking.&nbsp;“My “corridos” aren’t made to start controversy with anyone, they are made to entertain people, so they drink and have a good time, the reality, the economy and the whole world are going through tough times.” Larry has <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said on the topic</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>5. He’s a YouTube star&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Larry may be a&nbsp;darling of&nbsp;Latin music, but his big break came courtesy of YouTube. His music was so buzzed about that people kept uploading videos of his performances online. From that, he gained more notoriety — and the attention of record execs — and the rest was history.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you shocked that Larry was arrested?</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>— Samantha Wilson&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH5xe49rZrCgn2K2tHnLmqmrsV2dsrO6wKebnrJdorK5tcKapWarmaO0pr6MmqmrnaOpsqV5yqKbp5mgpbavs4yaqqyZpaHBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
