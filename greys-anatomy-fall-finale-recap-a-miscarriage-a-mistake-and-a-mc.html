Consider this summation:
Meredith Grey might have a new man … thanks to Cristina Yang.
Indeed, that’s not a sentence we expected to write heading into an episode titled &#34;Let’s All Go to the Bar.&#34;
But Meredith was back at work this week after finally getting reinstated, receiving a care package upon her arrival from her former &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You’re a guest in my home,” Meredith told him.</p><p>When Meredith later told Cristina she never got the package, she was taken aback to learn that she did: This new doctor was the package!</p><p>Yang referred to him as “McWidow” because he lost his wife to a medical condition, giving our favorite physician someone new to consider after Andrew Deluca broke up with her last week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Elsewhere, with Alex Karev away, Jo got a call from Station 19 that a baby had&nbsp; been dropped off at the fire department.</p><p>Because this actually happened to her as a child, Jo suffered through a lot of guilt about leaving the little one with a social worker, deciding to keep it for herself.</p><p>She didn’t even tell Alex, though, as Link was the first one to find out.</p><p>Feels like it could be an issue down the road, huh?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Also elsewhere:</p><p>Shepherd had put off getting an ultrasound for 20 weeks, finally giving in and agreeing to see a doctor.</p><p>She discovered during her appointment that she was in fact 24 weeks pregnant, a finding that came with pretty dire circumstances because the baby’s father could be Link or Owen!</p><p>As you might expect, she was horrified by the news… and definitely had some explaining to do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On her end,&nbsp;Maggie was scheduled to perform a surgery on a patient that she had operated on multiple times before.</p><p>This time, though, still in shock after her cousin died, Maggie basically lost it while operating.</p><p>At one point the surgery, the man’s heart wouldn’t restart — and the episode ended without viewers knowing if he lived or died, but with Pierce arriving at a monumental decision:</p><p>SHE QUIT!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I had a bad feeling.
