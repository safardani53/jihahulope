Heck, I can't even carry in groceries without mumbling to myself, "I carried a watermelon." If you haven't seen Dirty Dancing — first of all, how? Second, you have certainly heard at least one line from the film (we'd bet it's "Nobody puts Baby in a corner") or had that iconic final song stuck in your head.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless, we hope you have the time of your life reading through these fun facts about Dirty Dancing.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>It's (loosely) based on screenwriter Eleanor Bergstein's real life.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Emphasis on "loosely." Bergstein did spend her summers in the Catskills, her father was a doctor, she did go by "Baby" and, naturally, she loved to dirty dance.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The film is well known not only for its story, but for its amazing soundtrack.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey in Dirty Dancing (1987).</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before the film's music won awards though, the crew had to scramble to afford the music that Bergstein insisted on including. Eventually, all of the songs she asked for made it into the film, including original songs like "She's Like the Wind" by Patrick Swayze, "Hungry Eyes" by Eric Carmen and "(I've Had) The Time of My Life" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. The soundtrack sold over 30 million copies.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The song's final song, "(I've Had) The Time of My Life" was chosen literally the night before the cast and crew shot the finale.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The song would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song — and the unofficial award for "best way to end a wedding reception."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Jennifer Grey was 26 at the time she accepted the role to play 17-year-old Frances "Baby" Houseman, while Patrick Swayze was 34.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Globe Photos</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Winona Ryder and Sarah Jessica Parker were also up for the role of Baby.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella, Ltd./WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to the film's producer</a>, Linda Gottlieb, "Jennifer Grey was pushed into the audition room by her father and we were in love." Bergstein says, "As she walked in, she said, 'Wish me luck, Daddy,' and she just closed the Baby's face in my mind, and from that moment on she was the only person I wanted."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Benicio Del Toro, Val Kilmer and Billy Zane were up for the role of Johnny Castle.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Everett</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You know, the same Billy Zane who played the villainous Cal in Titanic? "But he danced like someone who looked like he had learned to dance beautifully for his bar mitzvah," Bergstein said in Netflix's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Movies That Made Us</a>, and they needed someone who could really sell it as a dancer.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Bergstein picked out Swayze for the role of Johnny Castle from a Rolodex of photos of eyes.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Vestron/Kobal/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wanted hooded eyes," Bergstein said in Movies That Made Us. "So we went through picture after picture and I said, 'Ah! Those are the eyes I want.'"</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Grey and Swayze had plenty of on-screen chemistry, but off-screen were not friendly. In fact, he had to convince her to take the role.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She begged us to have anyone but Patrick," Bergstein said of Grey's animosity toward her costar. The pair had worked together on the 1984 film Red Dawn and had not gotten along. When Bergstein explained that Grey did not want to do the film with him, Swayze offered to talk with her. "He went in alone and he sat with Jennifer about half an hour and they came out with their eyes red," and the pair were solidified as Johnny and Baby.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>And you can see them clash on-screen.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Everett</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swayze had been a dancer for his entire life, much like his onscreen character, while Grey had very little experience. That meant that all of their pent-up frustrations were channeled into their roles, and we can see them really working together (and arguing) on-screen. They do say that art imitates life, right?</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>But you can also see them having a great time together.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The famous "Love Is Strange" scene was really just footage of the pair rehearsing and fooling around before filming the real thing.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>During filming, they called it "Dancing Film Productions" so that the Mountain Lakes Resort where they filmed didn't think they were making a movie about a different kind of dirty dancing.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Everett</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">PS: You can <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>stay in the hotel</a> where they shot the film, though it's not in the Catskills!</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Swayze hurt himself while filming one of the film's many iconic scenes.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swayze refused to use a body double during the scene when the pair dance on a log over a ravine. His injury ended up holding up production for the film, which already had a minuscule budget. It also aggravated a knee injury he sustained while playing football in high school, making that final dance all the more difficult for him.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>It was so cold while they filmed the scene where Johnny lifts Baby in the lake that they couldn't have any close-up shots of the pair.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Pacific Title and Art Studio.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though it took place in the summer, the movie was filmed during October, and the water was so cold that the actors' mouths were blue.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Patrick Swayze hated the film's most iconic line.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I mean, to be fair, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner" doesn't really make sense for the scene. There's not a corner in sight! But go ahead and watch it again, you know, for old times' sake.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>That big lift at the end? It was never rehearsed.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I only did it on the day I shot it," the actress revealed in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a>. "Never rehearsed it, never done it since."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I would never practice the lift — I was too scared. The day you see me do it in the movie is the first time I do it," Grey told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>SELF</a> of the iconic lift. She also told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Guardian</a>, "I don't know how all these people who re-enact it have the guts to throw themselves into the arms of anyone other than Patrick Swayze."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0miboqqkrnqlrc2coKefXZvCr3nFmpqtq12Wu6%2B11Z6prJmirnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
