Though, Liza recently noted that she will not be posting another break-up video with any future partners.</p><p>“There’s a lot that people know about me, yes, but there’s a lot that people don’t. That’s why I made skits and sketches and characters. I always wanted to keep something to myself," she told Cosmopolitan. “We needed to get our truth off our chests. Not that we owed it to the community — they deserved to know, but it was also for us. It was just our truth and we needed to live it."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Since then, she has mainly kept her personal life private and no longer talks about dating or her relationship status. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoba7rYykpqygqWK9or7Ep6us</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
