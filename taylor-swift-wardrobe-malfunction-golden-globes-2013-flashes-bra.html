While she seemed covered up from the front, she gave us an eyeful when she turned around and flashed her bare back — and that’s not all we caught a glimpse of! From the side of the dress we were able to see the star’s chest, (and bra!). Clearly she had cups holding up her frock, and they were totally visible from the side as she glided down the red carpet — at least now we know how she managed to look so put together in this seriously sexy dress!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Poor Taylor! We doubt she wanted to flash the top of her bra. While this revealing slip was definitely embarrassing, luckily no body parts popped out and she managed to stay covered up in her gorgeous red carpet get-up. Wearing the proper undergarments can really save the day, and that seems to be the case in this instance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>When she stepped out for the People’s Choice Awards wearing a gravity-defying, plunging white Ralph Lauren gown, we were surprised she didn’t pop out of her dress — but luckily she managed to avoid showing off more than she bargained for.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Unfortunately the same can’t be said about her Golden Globes get-up, but what do you think? Is Taylor’s style slipup totally embarrassing or really not that bad?</p><h3>Katrina Mitzeliotis</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow<br>@KatrinaCM</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH1ye5BtZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2srrOw0aiZnmWdlrmnwc2cq6KnnmK0sLjDnqVmn5ykr6a%2FjGtnamtdm7miv8eeqmaaopZ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
