Now that summer is here, all of your favorite celebrities are showing out for the warm weather. On June 15, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olivia Munn</strong></a>, 37, took to Instagram to share a photo of herself and a group of friends at a picnic all dressed in bikinis. However, Olivia nearly had a nip slip as her sexy olive green one-piece was extremely low-cut! Luckily, she was able to keep it all together, and she looked incredible doing so. She paired the suit with daisy duke shorts and oversized tortoise shades.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While she was able to walk away from this situation wardrobe malfunction free, she hasn’t always been so fortunate. Back in May the Six actress accidentally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>flashed her panties</a> after her appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers. Dressed in a sheer multi-colored dress, Olivia’s white lace thong was blatantly visible from the back, and paparazzi got it all on camera. Although it was a bit embarrassing, we can at least say Olivia has really nice curves! What is her gym routine?!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Lately, Olivia has been killing it when it comes to fashion. Just a few days after her Late Night visit, she was spotted out in NYC strutting the streets in a floral maxi dress paired with magenta knee-high boots. So chic, right? And before then, she turned heads in a figure-hugging gold-chained dress designed by <strong>H&M</strong> at the Met Gala on May 7th.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>She pulled the look together with deep red lipstick and a stunning gold headpiece. It fit right in with the theme Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination. We’re loving her style, and can’t wait to see more breathtaking looks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH13e5BuZqikmau2onnMrqWnZZGrvKqw0maumqqUp7yjsYymmKWepaOwtbXOp2Slp6disLbAjK2mqWWgnrBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
