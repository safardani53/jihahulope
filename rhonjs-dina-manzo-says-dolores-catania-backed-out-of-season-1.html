She officially joined the cast in 2016 when the show was on its seventh season.</p><p dir=ltr>Around the time season 7 aired, she opened up about why she decided to give reality TV a go. “It just wasn’t the time for me when it had started and now I feel like I have a story,” she told <a href=#>TooFab</a> in July 2016. “I have something to offer. You know, I’m 45, I’m reinventing myself, my kids are grown and things like that. I have to really find my way now.”</p><p dir=ltr>The former corrections officer admitted that being on reality television has felt “so natural” to her. “I want to compare it to, like, a college experience. It’s like my sorority. That’s what it feels like,” she added.</p><p dir=ltr>Caroline, for her part, left The Real Housewives of New Jersey after its fifth season wrapped in 2013. From 2014 to 2016, the 58-year-old <a href=#>appeared on a spinoff series</a> titled Manzo’d with Children for three seasons.</p><p dir=ltr>The Let Me Tell You Something author claimed in April 2019 that <a href=#>she rejected an offer to return</a> to The Real Housewives world for season 10. “They wanted me back to see how I blend with the women — that’s an insult,” she alleged on the <a href=#>“Dear Albie” podcast</a>, which is hosted by her sons <strong>Chris</strong> and <strong>Albie Manzo</strong>. “<a href=#>I helped build that show</a>. I wasn’t the cause of that success, I was part of that puzzle. A very, very important puzzle.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr>Caroline continued, “Point is, you don’t insult me like that. You don’t insult me like that by saying, ‘Let’s see how you do.’ You know how I’m going to do. You know how I’m going to blend, and you know what I’m going to bring.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp56fwG6wyKeYZqWRo8ewedKasKxllKS5sL7ErGScmaSWu6qtjJuYnKOVmXqwwdNmpp9lo5qutLvNZmho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
