Send these to your March 21-April 19 friends, or to the friends of yours who fear the Aries wrath (which would be the Taurus and Libras of the group).&nbsp;</p><p>On the off-chance you can't figure out your friends' birthdays or which ones of them are Aries, we've found a trick that works pretty flawlessly (you're welcome). Think of the baddest, bossiest, most confrontational friends you have and then subtract all the known Leos from that group.</p><p>That should leave you with your favorite Aries friends, who, you can trust, are already going off about it being Aries season. Send them these memes to stoke their fire and congratulate them for being born.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1.

Seriously, I can think of four people off the top of my head this applies to.

Why go for the chill road when an Aries' whole brand is being confrontational and in your face?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagramv</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. The rest of the signs don't get it, but you do you, Aries.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Not to out myself, but I feel like this one applies to Geminis as well.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Ever try to date an Aries? Yeah, us neither.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8.

OK we're crying at how real this is.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. You just have to accept that every Aries is bad at apologizing.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. It's so useful to keep Aries around, they're always the biggest cheerleaders.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16.

OK I had to check and the Fonz is a Scorpio, but this one applies to Scorpios as well.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">19. The more I think about it, the more I think Aries and Cancers could fall in love with each other within the first 5 minutes of meeting.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">20.
