The actor was photographed walking around the set of the upcoming biopic about the band, which is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>directed by <strong>Martin</strong> <strong>Scorsese</strong></a>, in West Hollywood, CA on Nov. 30, and looked a lot like the late singer with a bushy beard and long hair. He also wore a tie-dye hoodie and matching shorts by Camp High, which was clearly inspired by the 1960s era in which Jerry lived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jonah-Hill-Jerry-Garcia-Martin-Scorsese-Grateful-Dead-backgrid-post-1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>In addition to his shirt and shorts, Jonah wore tie-dye socks and Off-White x Nike Dunk Lows that appeared to be a tribute to their fashion designer <strong>Virgil Abloh</strong>, who died at the age of 41 a few days ago. He also puffed on a cigarette and looked relaxed as he gets ready to film what will definitely be a memorable flick.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The untitled Grateful Dead biopic will “chronicle the band’s formation in the Bay Area as the ’60s psychedelic counterculture movement started to take off,” according to <a class=class href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. The band was known for being one of the bands that catapulted the rise of psychedelic counterculture and toured the country with devoted fans known as Deadheads. Jerry, who struggled with heroin and cocaine addictions throughout his life, died of a heart attack at the age of 53 in 1995.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jonah-Hill-Jerry-Garcia-Martin-Scorsese-Grateful-Dead-shutterstock-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>In addition to starring in the highly-anticipated film, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jonah</a> will produce it with his company Strong Baby along with his producing partner <strong>Matt Dines</strong>. <strong>Scott Alexander</strong> and <strong>Larry</strong> <strong>Karaszewski</strong> of American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson will write the script and surviving Grateful Dead members <strong>Bob Weir</strong>, <strong>Phil Lesh</strong>,<strong> Mickey Hart</strong> and <strong>Bill Kreutzmann</strong> will executive produce it along with Jerry’s daughter <strong>Trixie Garcia</strong>, <strong>Eric Eisner</strong> and <strong>Bernie Cahill</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The movie is being developed by Apple and when asked about why he chose to direct it, Martin reportedly said, “The Grateful Dead were more than just a band. They were their own planet, populated by millions of devoted fans.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49rZqOnnpa1brTIpaNmmpWWv6V5y6iloGWYlrazecmeqauxXZyus6%2FImmSgqpGpsqfBy2abnpmUYrqwwsieZKmhk2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
