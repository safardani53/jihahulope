At first glance, she looks a lot like <a href=# rel=follow>Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow</a> sitting down somewhere in Vormir.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Upon closer inspection, it is more likely that Marvel has finally decided to introduce the Enchantress into the mix. It is all speculation at this point. However,&nbsp;the studio has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that&nbsp;Cailey Fleming will play young Sylvie in the Marvel spinoff.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the comics, Sylvie Lushton <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">turned</a> into Enchantress when Loki imbued her with mystical powers, which falls in line with the series trying to flesh out the MCU’s mercurial villain even further.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Sophia Di Martino As The Enchantress</h2><p>Now that the studio has announced a young Sylvie and the plot deals with time travel and time manipulation, it is likely that we get to see her grow into the prospect Young Avenger too.</p><p>Add to that the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">leaked</a> on-set photos of actress Sophia Di Martino dressed in a green costume, Enchantress’ signature color, and the hypothesis starts to take shape.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It would still be unwise to expect the on-screen adaptation of the comic character to make the jump as is. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Our best guess: the on-screen Enchantress will share a lot of the same backstory as her comic counterpart. However,&nbsp;her persona will be adapted to something&nbsp;more palatable for&nbsp;today’s world.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>The Lady Loki Rumors</h2><p>All that being said, many still <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">think</a> that the character depicted here is Lady Loki or a female version of the God of Mischief. This speculation also stems from the same leaked on-set photograph.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Many fans and outlets speculate that the green costume Di Martino donned is that of Lady Loki. However, there is one flaw to that argument: her hair. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lady Loki has long been portrayed as the female duplicate of Loki. Hence they share&nbsp;a lot of traits like their love for mischief, choice of costume, and hair color. As evident from the leaked photograph and the frozen frame from the trailer, the mystery woman’s hair is definitely not jet black.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>All in all, no matter who&nbsp;Di Martino plays in the much anticipated series, she definitely has a major role as she is listed right below Loki himself in the cast-list.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G8rLWMrKapoJmWeqW1jKaYq6yZo7xuwMeeZJ6mk52ur8DRnqqsZZyWsbp5y6iiomWiqrqwvtJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
