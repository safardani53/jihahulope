As you will recall, Meredith had a heart for Cece and was gearing up to harvest it to save the love guru.&nbsp;</p><p>That was moments before the storm plunged the hospital into darkness. Desperate to prove his he was worthy of being her man, DeLuca pressed on with finding a way to escape.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the elevator actually got moving, DeLuca persisted to get his point across to Meredith. He thought she was excellent, and he would be very interested in getting between the sheets with her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/11/meredith-celebrates-the-dead-683x1024.jpg><p>Grey was grinning from ear-to-ear, but she was not ready to get hot and heavy in an elevator.</p><p>Things took a turn when DeLuca revealed that his father was a famous surgeon in Italy. However, he operated on seven patients during a manic phase and saved four.&nbsp;</p><p>He was tried but acquitted because he had money and connections. In a genuinely romantic moment, Mer asked her beau to speak to her in Italian.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the translated version of what he said:</p><p>“When you finally let me kiss you, and you will let me kiss you, I won’t ever stop.”</p><p>Mer understood every single word he said, and the pair got close. Then the freaking door opened.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Cece, she started the hour in a bad way. Her vitals were dropping, and it was not looking good.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/meredith-dressed-up-for-her-date-819x1024.jpg><p>“My old heart is jealous of my new one,” she told Maggie.</p><p>One of the new interns, Taryn, worried that Cece was about to pass away and there was no heart ready because it was trapped in another elevator.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just think we’re gonna plummet, and Cece’s gonna die,” said Taryn to Bailey while in said elevator.&nbsp;</p><p>On the outside, Jackson was going all out to save Cece and went as far as threatening the hospital’s building manager because he wanted in that elevator stat.&nbsp;</p><p>When the manager did actually he help, he got his legs crushed by the doors of the elevator.&nbsp;</p><p>Cece continued to get closer to death and realized there was something amiss, so she chatted with Maggie about the surgeon’s love life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/ellen-pompeo-as-meredith-grey-on-greys-anatomy-752x1024.png><p>But the conversation was cut short when Cece flatlined.&nbsp;</p><p>Meredith tried to save her life and was ecstatic there was a heartbeat.&nbsp;</p><p>“We got a heartbeat,” Mer yelled. “Thank God — she told me she would haunt me.”</p><p>The next thing we knew, Mer was talking to Cece about her romantic interests, and the camera pulled back to reveal that Cece was dead.&nbsp;</p><p>Looks like not everyone can win, you guys.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/meredith-grey-on-greys-anatomy-season-14-1024x739.png><p>elsewhere on this wild installment:</p><p>– Maggie wanted to break some more rules to tell Jackson about Catherine’s cancer and sulked around the hospital as others told her not to.&nbsp;</p><p>– Bailey had an epiphany: She loved Ben and wanted to make everything right. She texted him before reaching out to Karev to ask for his help.&nbsp;</p><p>– Amelia, Teddy, and Owen all took the baby news well, with Teddy agreeing to stay in Seattle because the child could have two parents. In the end, Amelia said she was giving Owen time to consider his options.&nbsp;</p><p>What are your thoughts on this wild midseason premiere?</p><p>Hit the comments below.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grey’s Anatomy continues Thursdays on ABC.&nbsp;</strong></p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Grey’s Anatomy Spoilers: It’s About to Go DOWN in Season 15</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2V%2BcLPRnrCsZZGjrrW7zLJkq52Tlr1usMidZKadoqHCpK2Moaaoo12qvXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
