“I asked [the creator of the show] Sera Gamble, ‘Can I just do no more intimacy scenes?'” Badgley, 36, revealed in an episode of his “Podcrushed” podcast, which was posted on Thursday, February 9. “This is actually a decision I’d made before I took the show.”
The actor explained that his marriage to Domino Kirke inspired the career choice."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Before I took the show, it was a question, ‘Do I have a career if I don’t?’ Think about every male lead you’ve loved. Are they kissing someone? Are they doing a lot more than that?”</p><p>In season 4 of the hit Netflix series, which premiered on Thursday, Joe (Badgley) <a href=#>relocates to London to begin a new life as college professor</a> Jonathan Moore. He quickly <a href=#>falls in love with neighbor Kate (<strong>Charlotte Ritchie</strong>)</a> — but the pair don’t act on their attraction for each other.</p><p>“I said to Sera, ‘My desire would be zero, to go from 100 to zero,’” the Gossip Girl alum said on his podcast. “But I signed this contract, I signed up for this show, I know what I did. You can’t take this aspect out of the DNA of the concept, so ‘How much less can you make it?’ was my question for them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Penn-Badgley-Explains-Why-He-Asked-for-Less-Intimacy-Scenes-in-Season-4-of-You-2.jpg><p>Badgley <a href=#>praised the screenwriter for accommodating his request</a>, adding, “She didn’t even bat an eye. She was really glad that I was that honest, and she had a really positive response. She appreciated my directness, and she appreciated that I was being reasonable and practical. And they came back with a phenomenal reduction.”</p><p>The Maryland native started dating Kirke, 39, in 2014 and they tied the knot three years later. At the time, the doula recalled <a href=#>not expecting their relationship to get serious</a>.</p><p>“I was sort of getting used to being a single mom, maybe a little too used to it. I had a really good thing with my kid and we were like this little team. Penn and I were dating, but it wasn’t nearly as serious as it is now, of course,” Kirke, who <a href=#>shares 13-year-old son Cassius with ex <strong>Morgan O’Kane</strong></a>, told Hey Mama in 2018. “I didn’t think marriage was in the cards for us. So I was sort of just chugging along, surviving and getting through the days, and I think the difference now is that I’m really living.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before the pair expanded their family, Kirke <a href=#>praised Badgley for taking on the role of a stepfather</a>. “It’s really nice,” she exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2019. “The stepparent thing is definitely unchartered territory for me ‘cause I didn’t grow up with one, but … he takes care of him really well.”</p><p>The pair <a href=#>welcomed their first child together three years later</a>. “His heart shaped home ❣️ #40dayspostpartum,” the actress captioned an Instagram Story in September 2020 of their newborn son James on the bed with her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeepp5ir6KwxqWcsmWWnrmuscNmo56ro2LGsMGMoqWtoZ2WsLp50pycp52jYrG2sYytpmalkae%2Fqq3GnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
