Net Worth, Career, Salary</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-14</div><p><strong>Jon Hamm</strong> recently confessed that he returned 60% of his salary to the budget of Confess, Fletch. The Emmy-winning actor, whose net worth is believed to be more than $40 million, is said to have taken the choice when financiers declined to pay three more days of filming for the independent production.&nbsp;The original finance received for the film could only cover 27 days of filming, rather than the needed 30 days. When money for the last three days could not be procured, Jon Hamm and director Greg Mottola agreed to give up a part of their salary to make up for the financial imbalance.</p><p>Greg Mottola discussed the compensation reduction in an interview with Uproxx (via IndieWire) on Thursday, September 22. He stated:</p><p>“Basically, what we did was Jon returned 60% of his income to the budget.” I handed back part of my money, but not as much as Jon since he is wealthier than me and I have three children. We also purchased three extra days of shooting. We ended up spending 30 days in Boston and one day in Rome.”</p><p>Confess, Fletch is a criminal comedy film based on Gregory Mcdonald’s book of the same name. It was released for a short theatrical run on September 16, 2022, and is now accessible to view on demand. The film will also air on Showtime on October 28, 2022. Other notable actors in the film include Marcia Gay Harden, Kyle MacLachlan, Roy Wood Jr., and John Slattery.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Jon Hamm gave up half his salary to finish filming <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#ConfessFletch</a>.
