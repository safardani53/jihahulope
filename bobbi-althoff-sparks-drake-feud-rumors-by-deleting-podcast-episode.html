After the episode — which earned over 10 million views on YouTube — went missing from her channel and social media feeds, fans noticed that Althoff, 26, and Drake had allegedly <a href=#>unfollowed each other on Instagram</a>.</p><p>Althoff’s actions come one day after she poked fun at the singer via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “Really in my element here @ this guys concert,” she captioned a video of herself looking deadpan — which is how she portrays herself on her podcast — at one of Drake’s concerts while two friends sing and dance next to her.</p><p>The interview’s online erasure has left many questioning whether the two had developed bad blood. “I sense some beef,” one fan wrote via <a href=#>X</a> (<a href=#>formerly known as Twitter</a>). Another user <a href=#>joked</a>, “I love how people unfollowing each other is like the definition of beefing now.”</p><p>Neither Althoff nor Drake have yet to publicly address the drama. Us Weekly has reached out for comment.</p><p>Earlier this month, Althoff revealed she got the idea for her podcast back in April. “I’ve always done this character, which is dry humor,” she told <a href=#><strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong></a> and <strong>Justin Sylvester</strong> on the <a href=#>August 7 episode</a> of <a href=#>Today</a>. “And I was like, ‘I’m just going to bring her along for a podcast.’”</p><p>As for how she got Drake to appear on her podcast she simply slid into the musician’s DMs. “He saw my video with <strong>Funny Marco</strong>. And he liked it. And he followed me,” Althoff shared. “When I saw he followed me, I was like, ‘I’m going to ask.’”</p><p>Althoff noted her life has been “crazy” since the interview went viral. “ I always wanted [the podcast] to blow up, obviously. You, like, hope for something. It’s crazy when it actually happens,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Podcast-Host-Bobbi-Althoff-Sparks-Drake-Feud-Rumors-After-Deleting-Viral-Interview-With-Singer-2.jpg><p>During her since-deleted podcast interview with Drake, the musician opened up about why he <a href=#>hasn’t been in a rush to say “I do”</a> with previous partners. “It seems like a thing of ancient times,” he told Althoff, noting he thinks he will “eventually” get married to someone outside of the entertainment industry. “You asked me why I haven’t gotten married. The truth? I don’t think I can offer somebody what they’d be looking for right now.”</p><p>Drake — who has previously been romantically linked to <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Serena Williams</strong></a> and more — went on to note that he does not possess the “consistency” married couples have in their day-to-day lives. “I think my work is my priority, so I wouldn’t want to not be able to contribute as a partner,” he explained. “I just don’t want to disappoint someone, and I’m not, like, Amish.” (He also shares his son <a href=#>Adonis</a>, 5, with ex <strong>Sophie Brussaux</strong>.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabp5KXtm6ty62fqJ6WYsCxrdGkqmacopa4pnnFnqydZaKqurC%2B0maZsmWUmrmmwMinnmaon5mwor%2FTZpypoaOksaZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
