It’s clear that the elder comedy icon was a big influence on Jason.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Before Jason became George though, he wed his wife <strong>Daena E. Title&nbsp;</strong>in 1982, and they remain married to this day. She’s shown her love and support for him for decades, and they’re still going strong. Get to know more about Daena and her relationship with George here.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jason-alexander-wife-embed.jpg><h2>How Did Jason Meet Daena?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jason opened up about how he first got together with his wife during a 2015 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Late Late Show.</a>&nbsp;He revealed that they first met through his job. “I was working in a casting office, which was the only reason she ever agreed to go out with me,” he admitted.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The&nbsp;Seinfeld&nbsp;star admitted that he wanted to go all out for Daena. “I knew I was playing way above the rim with this girl,” he explained. “I took out $1,000 in cash. I went, ‘I don’t know what she’s going to want to do, but I’m going to do it.’ She was the cheapest date in the world.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>He revealed that their first date was to the now-closed restaurant Café Central, and they had some future stars working there at the time. Jason said that <strong>Bruce Willis&nbsp;</strong>was the waiter and&nbsp;<strong>John Goodman&nbsp;</strong>was the bartender. “It was a great night. I kept trying to make it romantic. I said, ‘Let’s take a buggy ride through Central Park!’ She went ‘What are you a dork?'” he recalled.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jason revealed that their courtship moved very quickly. “Within three weeks, we were living together. Within six weeks, I started proposing. She turned me down three times,” he said.</p><h2>She Began Her Career as an Actress</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>As evidenced in their first date story, Daena was an actress when she and Jason started seeing each other. While her husband became a TV star, Daena didn’t make many televised appearances as an actress. She played a cop in&nbsp;For Better or Worse,&nbsp;and she made uncredited <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>appearances in&nbsp;</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seinfeld</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Just Looking,&nbsp;per her&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a> profile.</p><h2>She’s Now a Painter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>While Daena has stepped away, she’s continued to stay in the arts. She’s been working as a painter since 1997. She mostly focuses on expressionism and feminism. She uses oils, mixed media, and acrylics. Her work has been featured at the Chelsea, NYC gallery Carter Burden, the Koplin Del Rio Gallery in Los Angeles, and in many more places, per her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>. She also regularly shares her work on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><h2>They Have Been Married Since 1982</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>While Jason admitted that he began proposing to Daena after only six weeks of dating, he did say that it took a little while before she said yes. “I had asked her to marry me many, many times, and gotten a ‘no,'” he said in the above-mentioned interview.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>He revealed that the time she said yes he had a billboard project his proposal in New York City. “Daena, I love you. Please Marry Me Forever,” the sign read. They tied the knot on May 31, 1982.</p><h2>They Have 2 Children</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>The pair are also proud parents to two adult sons:&nbsp;<strong>Gabe&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Noah.&nbsp;</strong>Both of their boys have followed their dad into acting careers. Gabe has had many roles in various TV projects and shorts. Most notably, he appeared in an episode of the TV series&nbsp;On Hiatus With Monty Geer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8maqqimXZa5psTAp5ueql2stqexjG5pamtkbIBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
