A manager’s job is highly volatile in modern football because there is no job security.</p><p>Dean Smith, for example, was instrumental in Aston Villa’s promotion to the Premier League for the 2019-20 season. Dean Smith did not have much of a reprieve after a disastrous start to the following season. After three years at Villa Park, the Englishman was fired after five consecutive Premier League defeats.</p><p>On that note, the five top executives could be fired in 2022.</p><h2>Number 5: Jose Mourinho</h2><p><strong>Jose Mourinho</strong> got a hot start in Rome, winning his first six games of the 2021-22 season. However, he has not been able to continue in that vein, as AS Roma has only won one of their last five Serie A games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jose-Mourinho.jpg><p>Following his disappointing spells as manager of Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United, the Portuguese was appointed manager of Roma in the summer of 2021. That seemed like the ideal match for both club and manager, as Mourinho had made his name as a manager at Porto and Inter Milan in his early years.</p><p>Like the previously mentioned clubs, Roma is one of the most historic clubs in European football. However, their expectations and demands are far lower than those of Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. As a result, it was viewed as the ideal opportunity for Mourinho to reignite his illustrious managerial career.</p><p>Tammy Abraham was one of Mourinho’s first signings after the Portuguese moved to Rome, and he had a good start to life in the Italian capital. On the other hand, Mourinho could still be fired if he fails to stop Roma’s slide down the Serie A standings.</p><p>Rumors have also circulated that Jose Mourinho could be in line to take over as manager of the Portugal national team.</p><h2>Number 4: Carlo Ancelotti</h2><p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti</strong> is one of the most successful managers of the twenty-first century, having won 20 titles. The Italian is one of only a few managers in history to have won three Champions League titles with two different clubs, AC Milan and Real Madrid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Carlo-Ancelotti.jpg><p>This is Ancelotti’s second stint as manager of Real Madrid. When the Madrid job came calling, the Italian dropped a long-term project at Everton. So far, he’s done an excellent job with the squad. Real Madrid currently sits second in the 2021-22 La Liga table, one game behind table-toppers Real Sociedad.</p><p>Los Blancos won their next three UEFA Champions League games after a 2-1 defeat to Sheriff Tiraspol of Moldova. They currently sit atop the table and are heavy favorites to advance to the knockout stage.</p><p>Good performances, however, do not guarantee a position at the Santiago Bernabeu. During his first stint as Real Madrid manager, Ancelotti won four titles and the IFFHS World’s Best Club Coach award. However, when a better option in Rafael Benitez became available in 2015, he faced the sack.</p><p>If world-class managers like Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane become available in 2022, the same story could play out.</p><h2>Number 3: Massimiliano Allegri</h2><p><strong>Massimiliano Allegri</strong> is, without a doubt, one of Juventus’ most successful managers. He won five consecutive Serie A titles during his first stint at the club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aa.jpg><p>During his five-year reign from 2014 to 2019, the Italian also won four consecutive Coppa Italia titles and three Supercoppa Italiana. Allegri returned to management with the Bianconeri ahead of the 2021-22 season after a two-year hiatus.</p><p>In the two years that followed, Juventus suffered greatly due to the absence of their legendary star manager.</p><p>Last season, the Bianconeri failed to make it ten students in a row. On the final day of the 2020-21 Serie A season, they missed a spot in the top four. Juventus finished 13 points behind table-toppers Inter Milan.</p><p>Juventus emphasized a solid defensive foundation and a counter-attacking approach during Allegri’s second spell. However, Juventus’ brand of football has failed to bear fruit, as the club currently sits in eighth place in the 2021-22 Serie A table.</p><p>Many Juventus supporters believe that the team had reached its peak when Massimiliano Allegri was fired in 2019. As a result, Allegri may be out of a job heading into the 2022-23 season.</p><h2>Number 2: Mauricio Pochettino</h2><p>Every manager in the world would give an arm and a leg to be in <strong>Mauricio Pochettino</strong>‘s shoes. The former Tottenham Hotspur manager can select Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, and Angel Di Maria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mauricio-Pochettino.webp><p>Despite being one of the continent’s most talented managers, Pochettino’s trophy cabinet is relatively empty. Last year, in only his third game as manager of the Parisians, he won his first major trophy, the Trophee des Champions. He has, however, been unable to get the most out of his incredibly talented attacking players.</p><p>The Argentines also won the Coupe de France but did not win the Ligue 1 or Champions League. It was only the second time in the last nine years that PSG did not win the Ligue 1 title.</p><p>The Parisians are at the top of the Ligue 1 table this season. This is due to the underperformance of other teams rather than PSG’s dominance. The lens is in second place with 24 points from 13 games.</p><p>Pochettino could be out of a job in 2022 if PSG does not win the Ligue 1 title and mount a strong challenge in the Champions League.</p><h2>Number 1: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h2><p>Even though Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been threatened with dismissal from Manchester United on multiple occasions, he still holds that position.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer-2.jpg><p>The Norwegian has faced harsh criticism after poor results against Liverpool and Leicester City in the last month. Manchester United’s final three games before the international break were reportedly given to him to regain the club’s trust and keep his job.</p><p>The Red Devils have won one, drawn one, and lost one of their last three matches, but Solskjaer’s job appears safe.</p><p>Furthermore, Manchester United’s rumored replacement, Antonio Conte, has taken over at Tottenham Hotspur. The only world-class manager currently available on the market is Zinedine Zidane, who is hesitant to return to management.</p><p>In that case, Manchester United’s board of directors could stick with Solskjaer until the end of the season. The club may give the Norwegian a few more months to decide his future before approaching free agency.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanqurc2anp6qo2LEqbuMnKaupJRir6Z50pqapJ2UYraveZFpaWtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
