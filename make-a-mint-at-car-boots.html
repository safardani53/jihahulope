That's the best bit of advice for anyone."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><h2>Arrive early</h2><p>Selling at a car boot sale isn't for the faint-hearted, you'll often have to get up at the crack of dawn if you really want to make your time there worthwhile.</p><p>Of course, if your planning on selling you have to get there earlier than buyers to set up your stall, but Sonny recommends getting there as early as you can.</p><p>He explains dealers often look around to see what they can buy themselves - which means you'll have already made money before the buyers come.</p><h2>Quantity over quality</h2><p>Nobody goes to a car boot sale thinking they'll spend lots of money on one item, so don't bother trying to sell expensive stuff there.</p><p>"Be realistic at what you're going to sell the stuff for - don't overestimate what you're gonna get for stuff," Sonny explains.</p><p>The car boot sale pro recommends never pricing anything over £50 and to focus on quantity of items rather than quality if you really want to make money.</p><p>He adds: "&nbsp;If you're selling at car boot sales you're better off just taking as much as you can and selling it for like fivers really, so you want as many £5 items as you can take."</p><h2>Gone in a flash</h2><p>You might be thinking that there are certain items that are bound to sell well at a car boot sale - and you'd be right.</p><p>If you want to ensure you make money after putting in the effort to get up with the sun then keep reading.</p><p>The car boot sale whizz reveals that it's often the most boring items that sell like hot cakes, including pots and pans, gardening equipment and tools.</p><h2>Make people spend</h2><p>Turning up early with a boot full of stuff is just the start - now you have to make people want to buy it.</p><p>There's no point wasting time labelling items with how much you want for them, says Sonny, which makes sense considering half the fun of car boot sales is bargaining for a price.</p><p>If you're selling clothes it's worth getting a cheap clothing rail so that people can have a good look through.</p><p>For household items, its best to display them on tables or on the ground adds Sonny.</p><p>Most importantly, you should always start conversations with people passing and get off your phone.</p><p>Sonny reveals: "Don't be a miserable person, have a big smile on your face."</p><p>"Look people in their eyes and say hello - you know, start the conversation, don't expect them to start the conversation with you.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"Tell them how much things are as they’re walking past, entice them, have a bit of banter.&nbsp;Don't be shy, give it a try," he adds.</p><p>You can follow Sonny along his car boot sale adventures over on his YouTube account, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steptoe and Mum</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/make-mint-car-boots-one-759391222-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Bybm5saGWEcLnApJxmmV2itq%2FAjJqrZpuRp3qju86tqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
