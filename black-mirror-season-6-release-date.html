Although it does at times feel like our lives are just versions of Black Mirror episodes, we still want more of the dystopian Netflix series. And now, there will, in fact, be a Season 6 of Black Mirror. We’ll finally have something worse than reality itself to tune into."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While the Charlie Brooker series came from the United Kingdom’s Channel 4, when it moved to Netflix, its audience expanded exponentially. Season 5 dropped in 2019, and now in 2023, we're finally getting Season 6. So when is the Black Mirror Season 6 release date?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/dcwXjJZFT/200x200/headshot-1653400328516.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is the ‘Black Mirror’ Season 6 release date?</h2><p>Black Mirror Season 6 is set to hit Netflix on June 15, 2023.</p><p>While many fans at home have speculated that the reason we haven't gotten more Black Mirror in a while is <a href=#>Charlie Brooker</a> was done making it, the real reason was actually a classic contract dispute. Charlie and his production partner, Annabel Jones, left their production company, House of Tomorrow, under the parent company Endemol Shine Group, in 2020.</p><p>Together, they started working under Broke and Bones, which Netflix quickly bought into, producing <a href=#>Death to 2020</a>, Death to 2021, <a href=#>Attack of the Hollywood Clichés!</a>, and Cat Burglar. However, the rights to Black Mirror remained under Endemol. But in May 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> revealed that Banijay Rights, which acquired Endemol, finally reached a licensing deal with Netflix for Black Mirror after years of contract disputes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now, the news that Black Mirror Season 6 will return in June 2023 is welcome news!</p><p>Netflix's season summary warns us, "Expect the unexpected. The long-awaited return of Charlie Brooker’s dark, satirical anthology series which reinvents itself with each new episode. The sixth season of Black Mirror is the most unpredictable, unclassifiable, and unexpected yet."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Partly as a challenge, and partly to keep things fresh for both me and the viewer, I began this season by deliberately upending some of my own core assumptions about what to expect,” Charlie told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tudum</a>. “We’ve also got a few new elements, including some I’ve previously sworn blind the show would never do, to stretch the parameters of what ‘a Black Mirror episode’ even is. The stories are all still tonally Black Mirror through-and-through—but with some crazy swings and more variety than ever before.”</p><p>Season 6 will reportedly be very cinematic in scope, similar to Black Mirror’s fourth and fifth seasons. Unlike its first three seasons, once Black Mirror was acquired by Netflix, its episodes grew longer and its stars grew brighter. Household names such as <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href=#>Jon Hamm</a>, Bryce Dallas Howard, and more starred in Black Mirror’s later seasons.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Black Mirror Season 6 will be similar, with stars such as <a href=#>Zazie Beetz</a>, Paapa Essiedu, <a href=#>Himesh Patel</a>, <a href=#>Ben Barnes</a>, Kate Mara, Danny Ramirez, Aaron Paul, Anjana Vasan, <a href=#>Annie Murphy</a>, <a href=#>Michael Cera</a>, <a href=#>Salma Hayek,</a> <a href=#>Josh Hartnett</a>, and <a href=#>Rory Culkin</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">More big names include</a> Rob Delaney, Myha Herrold, Clara Rugaard, Auden Thornton, Daniel Portman, John Hanna, Monica Dolan, Myha’la Herrold, and Samuel Blenkin.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I can’t wait for people to binge their way through it all and hope they enjoy it — especially the bits they shouldn’t," Charlie shared.</p><p>Our only hope is that it will still be relevant — now almost a decade later, the series’ pilot episode no longer seems so far-fetched.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many episodes are there in 'Black Mirror' Season 6?</h2><p>Black Mirror Season 6 contains five episodes.</p><p>The first episode, Joan is Awful, dives into the life of “an average woman” who learns a “global streaming platform has launched a prestige TV drama adaptation of her life.” The average woman, as you might suspect, is played by Annie Murphy.</p><p>Episode 2 through 5 will release in this order:</p><ul><li>Loch Henry</li><li>Beyond the Sea</li><li>Mazel Day</li><li>Demon 79</li></ul><p>The first five seasons of Black Mirror are available to stream on Netflix and the streamer will drop Season 6 on June 15, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7mir8pmpKKqoqS%2Fbr%2FEmqqopl1rerOxy56YrJ1dma61sQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
