Brad, at one point, held tight to Jen’s wrist before the pair went their separate ways. The moment had everyone talking, even Jen’s former co-star and close confidant Courtney! The&nbsp;Scream actress even went as far as to ‘like’ an Instagram of the pair. What’s more Courtney is “thrilled to see Jen and Brad on such great terms. But more than that, she loves seeing her best friend so happy.
