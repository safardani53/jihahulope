His content predominately comprises mukbang videos. Mukbang is a video genre where an individual eats a lot of food in front of the camera.  
Perry has been doing this for many years, and its consequences are seemingly visible in his physical appearance. In addition, the weight gain has degraded his health throughout the years. 
Many creators have called him out, and one such creator is PewDiePie."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In addition, the weight gain has degraded his health throughout the years.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Many creators have called him out, and one such creator is <a href=# rel=follow>PewDiePie</a>. Perry responded to PewDiePie via YouTube, and now, there is a beef between the two creators. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Here we try to explain the drama between PewDiePie and Perry.</p><h2>PewDiePie Called Out Nikocado Avocado for Promoting Obesity&nbsp;</h2><p>Felix Kjellberg, best known by his online alias PewDiePie, recently uploaded a video titled '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">I hate mukbang</a>' where he discussed the Mukbang community on YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Perry was one of the creators PewDiePie talked about on his video and accused him of "blatantly promoting obesity." He watched a handful of Perry's content and said he was "the American final boss of mukbangs." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>PewDiePie then continued&nbsp;to express his displeasure with&nbsp;people&nbsp;who consume a lot of food. He stated he despised it because it grossed him out.</p><p>He also chastised YouTube and advised them to monitor the content on the platform. However, he agreed that while YouTube and creators in the Mukbang community might not condone it, children might be influenced by such videos.</p><p>I'm not saying YouTube needs to do anything about it, they just need to observe how it works. They're blatantly promoting obesity. I know the creators aren't condoning it, especially Nikocado — but kids are impressionable.</p><h2>Nikocado Avocado Responds To The Controversy&nbsp;</h2><p>As soon as&nbsp;PewDiePie's video went live, the feud escalated and&nbsp;it was shared by many sources. As a result, Perry responded to the controversy by uploading a video titled '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reacting to PewDiePie's video about me</a>.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He fueled the beef by calling PewDiePie "stupid," "an idiot," and "a hypocrite." He also said that PewDiePie did&nbsp;not make original content and simply did&nbsp;reaction videos nowadays.&nbsp;</p><p>Perry pointed out that PewDiePie was a hypocrite for saying that Perry influenced kids negatively because the latter used to play video games. Similarly, he added PewDiePie was responsible for the 2017 chaos of YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p>Back then, PewDiePie had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said the N-word</a> while playing video games. Moreover, he had allegedly shown anti-Semitic intentions&nbsp;with Nazi jokes.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This had resulted in YouTube cutting ads from every creator's content which directly affected their net worth. This situation was publicly known as the&nbsp;'adpocalypse.'</p><p>Similarly, Perry said that he did not promote obesity. Instead, he ate&nbsp;for other people. He claimed to be responsible for his viewers'&nbsp;weight loss since many people sent him letters saying so.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Perry added his viewers could not afford to eat like him since every mukbang video he makes costs over a hundred dollars. He also noted that he was not responsible for children viewing his videos.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>This was&nbsp;because he claimed it was the&nbsp;parents' responsibility&nbsp;not to leave their kids unsupervised. Moreover, Perry pointed out that he is not the only one who promotes fast foods.&nbsp;</p><p>Most fast-food chain restaurants have their ads on social media and billboards, so according to the YouTuber, kids might be influenced because of that.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>PewDiePie has not responded to Perry at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaZoLykrcOoZJqun5iupbuMqZywnJmavaqxjJucnp5encGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
