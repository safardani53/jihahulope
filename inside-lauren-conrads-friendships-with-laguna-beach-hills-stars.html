Reality TV cameras haven’t been following<a href=#><strong> Lauren Conrad</strong></a> for more than a decade, but that doesn’t stop fans from <a href=#>wondering about her status with her former Laguna Beach and The Hills costars</a>.</p><p>“I stopped filming and then I just kind of needed a clean break for a minute to kind of emotionally recover. I took some time off and then obviously moved out of L.A,” Conrad told former castmate <a href=#><strong>Whitney Port</strong></a> on her “With Whit” podcast in 2020. “It was one of those things where I was like, ‘OK, well, this isn’t like a healthy space for me anymore.’ I need to kind of, like, live my own life and do this. I kind of, like, removed myself from that whole scene. Really.”</p><p>The fashion guru was a <a href=#>staple on MTV for years after Laguna Beach,</a> which also starred <a href=#><strong>Stephen Colletti, Kristin Cavallari, Lo Bosworth</strong> and more,</a> premiered in 2004. Following two seasons of the high school series, Conrad landed a spinoff titled The Hills, which she appeared on for five and a half seasons from 2006 to 2009. The show, which also starred <a href=#><strong>Heidi Montag</strong>, <strong>Audrina Patridge</strong> and Port,</a> ended in 2010 after Cavallari took over for Conrad for the final episodes.</p><p>Conrad told Port that she is closer with her former Laguna Beach costars — a.k.a. her real-life high school classmates — than those on The Hills.</p><p>“So <a href=#><strong>Dieter [Schmitz]</strong></a> I talk to all the time. I don’t see anybody anymore but when we did, I see Stephen,” she told Port in 2020, citing the coronavirus pandemic as one of the reasons for the distance. “During holidays and stuff, I’ll usually see <strong>Christina Schuller </strong>or<strong> Morgan [Smith]</strong>.”</p><p>Conrad confirmed that she and husband <strong><a href=#>William Tell</a></strong>, with whom she shares sons Liam and Charlie, relocated to Laguna Beach.</p><p>“I live in my hometown. It’s more seeing people that I grew up with, who I also filmed a show with,” she said.</p><p>When MTV rebooted The Hills in 2019, Montag, Patridge, Port and more signed on, but Conrad had no interest.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I honestly haven’t seen it,” she confessed to Entertainment Tonight in 2021.”I think it’s great. I’m glad that they were able to do it again. … I actually don’t really watch any reality television. It’s a little triggering for me.”</p><p>Scroll through for a breakdown of Conrad’s status with her former castmates:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Beu7S1w55kpZmlp7KvecKopauZlKh6p77InqWdq5ievbR51qKroWWclrS2usBmmZ6Zk516qbXLpapmq6SWv7R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
