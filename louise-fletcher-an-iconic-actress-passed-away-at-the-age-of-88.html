Roberta, John, and Georgianna were her three siblings, and she learned to talk through her aunt. Louise made her television debut in series such as Lawman, Maverick, Untouchables, and others. She rose to prominence after being cast in Westerns due to her height. Louise said that since she was 5 feet 10 inches tall, no television producer felt a tall lady could be s**ually appealing to anybody. She continued,</p><p>‚ÄúI got gigs on westerns because the players were even taller than me.‚Äù</p><p>Louise Fletcher appeared twice as a guest on the CBS courtroom drama Perry Mason. In 1960, she portrayed Roberta McConnell in an episode of the Western television series Tate. She also acted in the 1974 crime picture Thieves Like Us, which her husband, Jerry Bick, co-produced.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Louise-Fletcher.jpeg alt="Louise Fletcher" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Louise rose to prominence after appearing in the 1975 psychological comedy-drama film One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest.
