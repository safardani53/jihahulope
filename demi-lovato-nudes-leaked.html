The hacking group encouraged viewers to "swipe up" to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">join a private group on Discord</a>, according to The Blast.

Luckily, Demi and her team noticed the breach of privacy within minutes, and they quickly tackled the situation.</p><p>According to Page Six, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the photos were removed almost immediately</a> &nbsp;from the "Sorry Not Sorry" singer's account. However, like any online content, the photos quickly spread to other online news outlets.</p><p>Apparently, this wasn't the hacker's first rodeo â€”&nbsp;according to Metro UK, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the hackers that allegedly leaked Demi's nudes</a> may have been linked to several other major privacy breaches in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the group in question was supposedly responsible for seizing the account of Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey. They are also believed to be linked to the nude photo leak of Chloe Grace Moretz earlier this year in February 2019.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans are worried about how this might affect Demi's mental health.</h2><p>Getting hacked can be extremely traumatic, especially if you're also dealing with other issues.</p><p>Last summer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the singer was hospitalized for an apparent heroine overdose</a>, according to CNN. And although she has since spoken out about her mental health â€” reassuring fans that she's been doing much better â€” fans of the singer are worried that this might affect her well-being in a detrimental manner.
