He shunned his father's attempts to teach him karate, choosing to live a sedentary life, playing video games, and eating waffles for breakfast.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>During the first and third seasons, Santopietro peeked like his character. He was on the chubbier side with shorter looks. But fans observed his change in physicality and personality in the fourth season.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Many fans maintained that Santopietro's weight loss was a hoax and social media scrutiny. What was it? Here is the breakdown.&nbsp;</p><h2>Griffin Santopietro's weight loss explained</h2><p>Santopietro's weight loss was evident to the fans during his journey from the first season to the fourth season.&nbsp;He had started playing the role at 12, and it seemed that his chubbiness matched the&nbsp;passive role. In 2022, the actor had already turned 16 when the fourth season was released. He had grown taller and slimmer.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Then, fans noticed Santopietro's appearance in Dhar Mann Studio's video,&nbsp;'Brother Hates his Little Bro, He Instantly Regrets It.' That made them realize the drastic differences in his appearance; his cheeks had slimmed, and his facial structure had slightly changed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=image-align-center></p><p><strong>Griffin Santopietro's character journey as Anthony on Netflix's&nbsp;Cobra Kai. </strong>(Photo: Central Cobra Kai/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Santopietro's weight loss became the talk of the town when the fourth season trailer was released. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A fan tweeted Anthony's pictures from the first and latest season in 2021. "The actor who plays Antony LaRusso looks very different in the new season of Cobra Kai. But don't be scared: it's the same actor!" the person wrote, quoting he looked like a different person.</p><h2>Griffin Santopietro's weight loss sparked debate</h2><p>Santopietro's weight loss had fans divided over the cause of it. Some argued he was going through puberty and the weight loss was natural. Others claimed he was being prepared for his upcoming part on the show.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The fans claiming natural cause marked the changes in 2020. In a 2020&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Pop alternative</a>&nbsp;interview, viewers talked about his slimmed facial structure and hoarse voice. "He may have thinned down, but that's just puberty. Despite what you think, not every time an actor loses weight is due to them becoming some big new character," a fan opined.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Others corroborated that he was bound to get a makeover for his character. Anthony's absence in the second season in 2019 was speculated to cause the reinvention of his character story. "He's slimmed down. That could be on purpose, so he trains with his movie dad," another fan remarked on Anthony's eventual link with martial arts.&nbsp;</p><p>Santopietro's weight loss journey could be the result of puberty and, at the same time, a needed measure to help his character become more like his father, Daniel. But the plotline of him going from gamer kid to karate kid is yet to be confirmed. The <a href=# rel="follow noopener">show's sixth season</a> is under production, and it may give a rest to the fan's queries soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Equally, it will not be wrong to state that Santopiero looks vastly different from when he started the show. His change in body size and shape might result from many other factors besides puberty, including diet, workout, and lifestyle choices.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Is&nbsp;Griffin Santopietro's age?</h2><p>Born on January 5, 2006,&nbsp;in&nbsp; Portland, Maine, Griffen Santopietro is 16 years old at the time of the writing.
