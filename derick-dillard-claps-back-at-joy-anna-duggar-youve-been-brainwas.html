The situation escalated earlier this week, when Joy-Anna Duggar seemed to throw major shade at Jill by &#34;liking&#34; a comment.
And not just any comment. A comment in which Jill and husband Derick Dillard were attacked by a random Instagram user."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s my thoughts … good for Jill.

Sometimes you have to burn bridges to protect yourself from abusers," a fourth person wrote.</p><p>Needless to say, the people were very much on Jill’s side – and so was her husband.</p><p>Derick "liked" all four of those comments.</p><p>In doing so, he let Joy know exactly how he feels without saying a word.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The Dillards seem to have become masters of such ingeniously shady moves in recent months.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href=#>Jill revealed that she’s teaching her kids about sex</a> so that they don’t fall victim to molesters.</p><p>Many who read her latest interview with Us Weekly interpreted her remarks as a subtle way of addrsessing the <a href=#>Josh Duggar sex scandals</a> and the fact that her parents helped to hide the abuse she endure in her youth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"We definitely want our kids also to have the ability to protect themselves," Jill said.</p><p>"In our bathroom, we have a little sign, "My Body Rules." If there’s a babysitter here in our home, they’re gonna see that too," she said.</p><p>Clearly, Jill is still affected by the trauma that she suffered in her youth, and she probably will be for the rest of her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It’s enough to make you wish those commenters had been a bit more harsh toward the person who actually had the audacity to tell Jill how she should feel about her parents and her childhood.</p><p>Just some food for thought.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2V%2FcLDEq6Cco12Ztq24wKubZpuclr20ecGamqRlkal6q7vYZpinppFisbazxpqpZrGfqsOmecGenKdlkqeuqrrWmqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
