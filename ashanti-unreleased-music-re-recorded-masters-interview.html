So I definitely have some records that I’m that I’m going to think about.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>So many people have become aware of artists working to regain control of their masters through Taylor’s recent project, which included re-releasing her 2012 album as&nbsp;Red (Taylor’s Version). Ashanti said that the “All Too Well” singer’s work for women in the industry deserves to be celebrated. “I’m so proud of her. I’m so happy that she stood up as a woman in music to demand and do what’s right,” she said. “I commend her so much. I think it’s amazing. And I’m so glad that we all supported her. You know, I think it’s beautiful.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ashanti-may-drop-unreleased-music-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Included in the re-recording is her debut single “Foolish,” which the singer also admitted has grown in the two decades since she first released it. “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A classic record</a>, a record that is heartfelt, is something that’s timeless, and it transcends through cultures,” she said. “I’m just super, super humbled and grateful that I was able to write a record that people can really relate to.” She noted that friends of hers now tell that the album “just hits different now that we really understand the words.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Other than re-recording her debut album, Ashanti also told&nbsp;<strong>HL</strong> what a great honor it was to receive the “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lady of Soul”</a> award. “I’m just very grateful. Soul Train is just such a staple in our culture,” she said. “To be aligned with some of the icons and the legends is surreal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5ByZpqrmJa7tbWMrqWrnZyarrSxw2akrquZmHqzsYyrnJynopmypXnMmqqtnaKoeqq6056pr6GVrHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
