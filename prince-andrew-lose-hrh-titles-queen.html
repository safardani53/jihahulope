The disgraced Duke, 61, facing a possible sex-case trial in the US, looked ashen-faced as he was driven in to see his mother.
Insiders said the decision to reduce Andrew — often called her “favourite son” — to a “private citizen” was one of the hardest in Her Majesty’s 70 years on the throne."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Andrew, a Navy helicopter pilot in the Falklands War, will still be allowed to wear his medals like other veterans.</p><p>SAS legend Rusty Firmin, who stormed the Iranian Embassy in 1980, said: “It was the right thing to do. He had to step back rather than tarnish the name of the regiments.”</p><p>Andrew was stripped of dozens of royal patronages for golf clubs, universities, yacht clubs, sports associations, medical institutions, charities and art establishments.</p><p>He retains his rank of Vice Admiral in the Navy handed to him in 2015 after retiring in 2001.</p><p>He is believed to have retained his Order of the Garter bestowed on him in June 2014.</p><p>As one of the Queen’s four children he stays as Counsellor of State — so he can step in for her if she is unable to perform her duties due to illness or absence abroad.</p><p>Last year Charles, William, Edward and Anne had ruled that there was no way back for Andrew.</p><p>William was understood to be at the castle on Wednesday.</p><p>Last night Andrew was hunkered down at his home, Royal Lodge, Windsor. Late on Wednesday, after the judge’s ruling, he had been in talks with lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic. Yesterday he spent three hours with his legal team from 8.30am before the Queen broke the news face-to-face.</p><p>His UK lawyer Gary Bloxsome accompanied him to the castle.</p><p>A source close to the Duke said: “Given the robustness with which the judge greeted our arguments, we are unsurprised by the ruling. But it was not a judgment on the merits of <a href=#>Ms Giuffre’s allegations.</a>”</p><p>Last night the Queen’s ex-press secretary Dickie Arbiter said: “I believe this is the end of Andrew. I don’t believe there is a way back.</p><p>“It was clear the Queen was waiting for the judge’s ruling. It is the right decision and an inevitable one. It would have been difficult for the Queen. She is a mother but also Head of State.”</p><p>Privy councillor Norman Baker said: “It is right that Andrew has returned his military titles. It had become an embarrassment all round, not least for the military.</p><p>"The fact the Palace is now describing him as a private citizen in respect of his court case tells us he has well and truly been chucked under the royal bus, yet the family cannot escape the immense damage that will increase as the case progresses.</p><p>"Can he even stay as Duke of York, or having been marched up that hill by the Queen, will he be marched down again?”</p><p>Andrew will be asked to make a witness statement in February where he could be questioned about his sex life and what he did with Ms Giuffre.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Sources close to the Duke insist his team are proceeding with disclosure but privately it is understood they are looking to propose a settlement.</p><p>Andrew vehemently denies all the claims against him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tp-graphic-andrews-titles-new-2.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Queen 'heartbroken' over Prince Andrew scandal as Royal family support 'thin on the ground', expert claims</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoR0fZdra21noKe2r6%2FEZpinnKKaxG64zqycZqCinXq1tdOlnKxloaqyprqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
