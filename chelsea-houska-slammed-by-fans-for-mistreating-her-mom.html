She’ll now have to drive for nearly an hour to spend time with her grandkids, and&nbsp;</p><p>2. Isn’t every part of South Dakota exactly the same anyway?</p><p>(Okay, we may have made that last part up.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I am just sick,” <a href=#>Mary said to Chelsea</a>. “But I don’t want to make you mad and all crazy if I say something.”</p><p>“Okay, mom. What do you have to say about it?” Chelsea said (with a bit of an attitude, if you believe some viewers.)</p><p>“I just can’t … I don’t even like to talk about it. It’s just so sad for me,” replied a tearful Mary.</p><p>“We’re going to be 45 minutes away,” Chelsea shot back.</p><p>“You have kids that live in Florida and Texas.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“No, I know,” Mary said. “It isn’t so much that you’re leaving, cause it isn’t that far. But you gotta think of it rationally.</p><p>"One, you’re only 15 minutes from me now, I’m by myself. I have to drive all the way down there after 5 [p.m.] cause I work til 5 [p.m.]. I can’t just get off, you know," said Mary.</p><p>"I just felt like it was too fast. You know, you kinda told me about it."</p><p>Chelsea responded, “I know, but you don’t know what we do and what we talk about and what we look at.”</p><p>“Just don’t rush into anything. Just really really think about it, cause I’m not trying to like,” Mary said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>”I’m not trying to sound like I’m selfish, cause I kinda am.”</p><p>“I understand how you feel,” Chelsea interjected.</p><p>“But I mean, these kids are all I got anymore. I’m gonna cry,” Mary said, beginning to sob.</p><p>“And just to think of you that far … I can’t get down there very much. I can’t go to every game. Or even in the winter, there’s no way I can drive — I don’t even now like to drive at night."</p><p>It went on like this, and Chelsea tried to end things on a positive&nbsp;note, promising her mom:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I’m sorry. We have to do what we feel is right, though. No matter what, we’re going to make it so you don’t feel like this. It’s not going to be as bad as you think it is.”</p><p>Hey, anyone with aging parents can relate, right?</p><p>Well, apparently not, as Chelsea was judged rather harshly on Twitter:</p><p>“I [heart] Chelsea & she’s my fave mom, but the no sympathy for your mother when she’s that upset & crying in front of u is extremely saddening to me. I could never stand in front of my mother that upset & trivialize her feelings & get irritated about them the way u just did,” tweeted one fan, as pointed out by In Touch Weekly.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I love Chelsea but I HATE the way she’s talking to her mom.. #TeenMom2,” another chimed in.</p><p>Some fans even went so far as to claim that Chelsea’s (allegedly) poor treatment of her mother is a result of Mary and Randy Houska’s contentious divorce several years ago:</p><p>“Chelsea has always been so hard and genuinely sh–ty to her mom. I’m sure it’s a byproduct of divorce, kids take sides, but it sucks and it doesn’t look good on her #teenmom2,”&nbsp;</p><p>And then there was the harsh critic who issued this devastating low blow:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Chelsea reminds me of Jenelle a little bit how she be talking to her mom," the viewer wrote.</p><p>Hey, there might be room for disagreement with regard to how Chelsea handled the situation with her mother.</p><p>But comparing her to Jenelle?</p><p>That’s a bridge too far, folks!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Chelsea Houska HUMILIATES Jenelle Evans: This is How You Launch a Business, Bish</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2Z9cK%2FHnqOsnZFitbDB0qSYZquclrquscNmmbJllpa7tHnFqKlmpZmowbOxwK2gp59dnbKzecyopGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
