He even “constantly” met with Madison’s family and friends to make sure everything would be perfect.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“He actually was supposed to come with me and my friends to Florida but he got sick and wasn’t able to make it,” Madison further explained. “I thought we were celebrating one of our friend’s birthdays. I was told we were taking birthday pictures on the beach and when I came down, my best friend led me into the bathroom where my mom and sisters were with the dress I wanted to get engaged in.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“In that moment, I knew,” she added. The future spouses, who can be seen in the previous pics above, took incredible pics in the white strapless dress that Madison wore during the proposal. Grant also looked handsome in a light blue blazer over a white top and matching light blue pants. They got cozy during the snapshots and one included the moment Grant got down on one knee to ask for his girlfriend’s hand in marriage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Madison and Grant’s engagement comes eight months after they started dating. It also comes after Bachelor fans got to know Madison when she appeared on the dating series as a contestant <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in <strong>Peter Weber</strong>‘s season</a> in 2020. She ended up being the runner-up to <strong>Hannah Ann Sluss</strong> but when Peter and Hannah’s engagement didn’t last, she reconnected with him. The reunion <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>didn’t</a> produce a long lifelong romance though, and Madison knows now, that Grant, who is a speaker and minister to athletes and churches, was the one she was supposed to end up with all along.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“I have waited for this day my whole life,” she said. “I am so excited that it’s finally here. He is everything I have prayed for, waited for, and dreamed of my whole life. He was definitely worth the wait.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e49qZqaZlJ7AsLqMqamer5WpwW6xzaCYoJ2UYrSzrc2tZK2qn6rBtXnDopimp56ZerO1zaBkqaGTZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
