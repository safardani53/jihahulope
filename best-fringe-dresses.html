The trend has continued into this season, with a plethora of fringed beauties available to shop now that are just perfect for soaring summer temperatures—festive season not needed.</p><p>Check out our faves below and see which fringe takes your fancy.</p><p>This article and featured products have been independently chosen by Sun journalists.
