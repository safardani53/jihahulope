In an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram tribute</a> to him, she explained that “everything happened so fast" and that his death "still doesn’t seem real.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I haven’t been able to find the words and still can’t,” Martin wrote as she shared several photos of herself with her dad, as well as two sweet shots of him with her son, Greyson. “Part of me is still waiting for one of your crazy phone calls. So many things left unsaid and moments we didn’t share. Trying not to dwell on the missed moments and focusing on the improvements we made.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued of her father, “You had a zest for life, and I know you’re having a party up in heaven. Rest in peace, dad. Love you. 🙏❤️🥹.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many of Martin's RHOM costars shared their love and support for her in the comments of the post, with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Guerdy Abraira</a> writing a particularly heartfelt note to her friend.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love you so much my beautiful friend. This Thanksgiving as you mourn, also be thankful for the good times. I’m so happy that your last moments with him were positive and loving. That’s all that matters, the good memories. He was the life of the party and always so positive and THAT is definitely a vibe to live by, counting each day as a blessing. ❤️🙏🏾”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alexia Nepola</a> wrote, “I’m sorry for your loss. Sending you love and light.” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Larsa Pippen</a> joined in, commenting, “So sorry for your loss. Sending u lots of love and prayers 🙏🏼.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dr. Nicole Martin and her fiancé Anthony Lopez.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jason Koerner/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The news of Martin’s loss comes after she exclusively revealed to PEOPLE earlier this month that she and fiancé <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Anthony Lopez</a> are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>expecting their second child together</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Anthony and I wear many hats, but we always say that being parents is by far our favorite!" she said of the pregnancy news. "We have so much fun with Greyson and are over the moon about expanding our family."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple’s baby is due in April, and Martin said that Greyson, 4 ½, is excited about his sibling-on-the-way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Oh, he is very excited about the addition to our family," the anesthesiologist shared. "He has been asking for a sibling for quite some time, and I know he's going to be a wonderful big brother."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to their 2021 engagement, Martin and Lopez had been together for more than seven years — and had welcomed their first child together. After her longtime love popped the question, the Bravo star told PEOPLE she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>didn’t always think marriage was in the cards for her</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've never been opposed to the idea of getting married, I just think a lot of people put too much pressure on the concept of marriage and use it as a means of creating security and happiness. Those things don't come from marriage, they come from inside you," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The expectant mother added, "In my own personal experience, marriage did not mean happily ever after. So instead of focusing on getting married again, I focused my time and energy on what truly matters — being happy and creating a life I love. That has really been my priority these past few years — Anthony and I have a great relationship, we wanted a family and have an amazing son we adore, we are established in our careers, we remodeled our dream house, we traveled and have made incredible memories. Neither of us has prioritized marriage because we have been busy enjoying our lives."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dr. Nicole Martin celebrates her engagement to Anthony Lopez.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She gushed of her fiancé, "Anthony has always respected me as an individual. He's never tried to change me. He has been incredibly supportive of me and my career. He pushes me to grow and be better. We have grown together over the years and I've loved every moment of it. Plus all the other obvious points — he's funny, he's witty and he's handsome.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6KdvK55w6tkp6GTpLmmecyaqa2hnmKur7rOrqWcnaNisaat06Fkn5mknbKzeZdtZ21tZGw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
