Trey, 35, released Back Home, on Oct. 9, which was filled with 22 tracks of classic, good-for-the-soul R&B. As an added surprise, Trey dropped a music video for track No. 21, “I Know A Love,” dedicated to his one-year-old son <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Noah Neverson</strong></a> whom he shares with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Caro Colon</a></strong>. The visuals were a montage of videos and photos revealing sweet moments between the son and father, like their cuddle sessions and many fun hangouts.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The fact that <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@TreySongz</a> gave his son a writing credit on every song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 boy gonna have a bag before he can talk.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Maserati Maine 🕊 (@maserati_maine) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>October 9, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Trey further proved that he’s the best dad ever by giving his one-year-old a songwriting credit on every single track on his new album, which a few fans pointed out on Twitter! <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">“The fact that @TreySongz gave his son</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> a writing credit on every song is [fire emojis] boy gonna have a bag before he can talk,” one fan tweeted. Trey’s baby boy actually made his music video debut in the visuals for the album’s title track “Back Home,” T</span>rey’s collaboration with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Summer Walker</strong></a> that details a complicated romance, one that brings “happiness and pain.” The video was released in April, and was filmed amid quarantine — you can watch it below.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While appearing on The Quicksilver Show in May, Trey revealed that he wanted to sign Summer before the “Playing Games” singer was famous. “I had this song that I would listen to and I forgot who sent it to me,” he said, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Revolt</a>. “So it’s like two years, I would listen to this girl singing this song, the ‘Girls Need Love’ song … I text every producer that I know personally like, ‘Do you know who is singing this song? I love this girl. I wanna sign this girl.’ And then like two years later after all that, Summer Walker comes out with ‘Girls Need Love.’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Trey’s new album also contains “2020 Riots: How Many Times,” a song he released in June following the deaths of <strong>George Floyd, Breonna Taylor</strong>, and other Black men and women at the hands of the police. ““Three or four nights ago I woke up in the middle of my sleep…I couldn’t sleep. My chest was hurting. I got up and called my producer, Troy Taylor and I said ‘We’ve got to make music that really touches the soul, that really addresses what the world is feeling right now. Especially our people,’” Trey said in a statement, per <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>. Trey’s passion would lead him to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>brush up against <strong>Meek Mill</strong></a>, resulting in a back and forth between the rappers. Needless to say, Meek doesn’t feature on Trey’s new album.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/trey-songz-generic-art-ap-images-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Unfortunately, the celebration for Back Home’s release was cut short when <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he tested positive</a> for COVID-19. I’ve taken many tests as I’ve been out protesting, food drives, of course, I have a very young son at home, so I get tested periodically and this time it, unfortunately, came back positive,” Trey said on Oct. 6. “7.5 million Americans have contracted Covid. One out of a thousand black people have died from it. I will be taking this seriously. I will be self-quarantining. I will be in my house until I see a negative sign.” Unlike other musicians who have seemingly blown off the dangers of the pandemic, Trey said that he’s always taken COVID seriously.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I don’t know how many of y’all know but my grandfather passed earlier this year, and while it wasn’t said that it was COVID, I do believe it was,” he added. “I’ve always taken it serious, and if you come into contact with COVID, please do the same. Don’t be like the president [<strong>Donald Trump</strong>.] I thank you in advance for your support and love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49yZq2qla56tLvNoLFmq5%2Bjeq7B0qKaZq6ZmbKwechmoqenp2KubrjOr5xmpp%2BWtXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
