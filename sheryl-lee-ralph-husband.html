Meet her husband, Vincent Hughes!</h2><p>Sheryl was married to her ex-husband, Eric Maurice, for 11 years before they divorced in 2001. It wasn’t until 2005 that she married her current husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sen. Vincent Hughes</a>.</p><p>Born in Philadelphia, Vincent studied at Temple University. The politician secured a spot as a member of the Pennslyvania State Senate in 1994. Before that, he served as a member of Pennslyvania’s House of Representatives for nearly a decade.</p><p>Sheryl and Vincent first met by way of a mutual friend in the early 2000s. They later married in an intimate service surrounded by their closest friends and family members at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles.</p><p>In a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESSENCE</a>, Vincent described Sheryl as a “blessing”.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Sheryl Lee Ralph, Vincent Hughes</p></figure><p>“Life could have been very, very different for both of us.

When they tied the knot, both Sheryl and Vincent had kids from past relationships.</p><p>“When it comes to blending your family, you have to figure out who you are in the relationship,” she said of her union with Vincent. “I’m not trying to be his children’s mother, because they already have a mother, and they love her. Just like Vincent is not trying to be my children’s father.”</p><p>So, how many kids does Sheryl have?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Etienne Maurice, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Vincent Hughes, Ivy-Victoria Maurice</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sheryl Lee Ralph has two kids.
