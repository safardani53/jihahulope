So, I would ask the sympathetic to say a prayer for my precious 8-year-old granddaughter Bella, who previously lost her father and is now also left without her mother.”</p><p class=p3>Bobbie Jean’s cause of death has not been publicly shared, though a source exclusively told<i> Us Weekly</i> that her loved ones believe that she suffered cardiac arrest.</p><p class=p3>Bobbie Jean is survived by daughter Bella, mother Jane and siblings Nick and <strong>Angel Carter.</strong> (Jane and ex-husband Robert Carter, who died in 2017, shared Nick, Bobbie Jean, Leslie Carter and twins Angel, 36, and Aaron Carter.

You had a great sense of humor and a lively spirit. Growing up, I was your baby, and you were my best friend,” Angel wrote, uploading throwback family photos. “Life wasn’t fair to you, that I know. Sometimes, it feels like you didn’t have a shot, no matter what. Experiencing innocence instead of being burdened by trauma, pain and suffering is incredibly important for children, particularly at such a young age.”</p><p class=p3>Angel concluded, “I know why Leslie, Aaron and now you ended up in the circumstances that you did. I share that pain we experienced during our childhood and I’m sorry you didn’t have an opportunity for a better life. … I love you BJ, you’re free now. <span class=s1>💔🕊️</span>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGanoZOgeqSt0a2cq2WTnbKztdKhnKxllpa6qrjYZqSopZWjwbR5wJ%2BrnqpdqLa0wMSrZJunkpe2pnnJnpinq12ZsqLAx2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
