Messer!</h2><p>We’ll begin with the most important question of all.</p><p>And Leah’s been through so many changes over the years there were probably times when she struggled to answer this one herself!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/leah-messer-on-mtv.png><h3 id=h-who-is-leah-messer>Who Is Leah Messer?</h3><p>Leah Messer is a West Virginia native who first gained fame with her 2010 appearance on MTV’s 16 and Pregnant.</p><p>Leah, just 17 at the time, was expecting twins by boyfriend Corey Simms, whom she had only recently started dating.</p><p>The twin girls, Aliannah Hope and Aleeah Grace Simms, were born prematurely via c-section, and the challenges of parenthood soon put a serious strain on Leah and Corey’s relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/12/leah-and-corey.png><p>The couple eventually separated, after Corey learned that Leah had cheated on him.</p><p>But against all odds, Corey and Leah later reconciled and tied the knot!</p><p>Unfortunately, the marriage didn’t last long.</p><p>Leah and Corey got divorced in 2011, and she wasted no time in moving on.</p><p>The divorce was finalized in June, and less than a year later, Leah married Jeremy Calvert.</p><p>Leah and Jeremy welcomed their first child together, a girl named Adalynn, in February of 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/04/leah-messer-is-mad-640x1024.png><p>Once again, co-parenting proved to be more of a strain than the couple could handle, and Leah and Jeremy went their separate ways not long after Addie’s first birthday.</p><p><a href=#>Leah and Jeremy got back together</a> and broke up many more times in the years that followed, but eventually, they parted company for good.</p><p>After washing her hands of Jeremy, <a href=#>Leah vowed to stay single for a while</a>, but it wasn’t meant to be!</p><p>She went on to have semi-serious relationships with T.R. Dues and Jason Jordan, but it wasn’t until recently that she appeared to be headed for the altar for a third time.</p><p>Leah began dating Jaylan Mobley in 2021, and the two of them moved very quickly.</p><p>Unfortunately, the relationship deteriorated just as rapidly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><h3 id=h-what-happened-to-leah-lesser-and-jaylan-mobley>What Happened to Leah Lesser and Jaylan Mobley?</h3><p>Leah Messer and Jaylan Mobley separated abruptly in 2022 under mysterious circumstances.</p><p>Fans are dying to know what happened, but Leah is unable to speak on the situation due to the terms a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p>But it’s tough to keep secrets when you have a few million social media followers, and the details of the surprising split have started to leak out.</p><p>Multiple insiders have now confirmed that<a href=#> Jaylan was caught cheating on Leah</a>.</p><p>But it seems the infidelity was just the final nail in the coffin, as the relationship had been going downhill for quite some time.</p><p>Leah and Jaylan got engaged just weeks before they broke up, and his proposal contained a major red flag.</p><p>Publicly, the couple claimed that<a href=#> Jaylan bought Leah a house</a> and surprised her with the deed as part of his proposal.</p><p>The story didn’t make sense from the start, as Leah was the one with all the money in their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/leah-messer-in-2019.jpg><p>It later came out that Leah and Jaylan bought the house together, and he presented her with a deed that mysteriously did not have her name on it.</p><p>In one of her rare comments on the subject, Leah recently revealed that she believes the document was fraudulent.</p><p>Needless to say, she dodged a bullet by kicking Jaylan to the curb!</p><h3 id=h-are-leah-messer-and-jaylan-mobley-back-together>Are Leah Messer and Jaylan Mobley Back Together?</h3><p>In recent weeks, there have been rumors that Leah Messer has decided to give Jaylan Mobley a second chance.</p><p>Thankfully, it looks as though there’s no truth to those reports.</p><p>She may have made some questionable decisions in her life, but we doubt that Leah would ever be foolish enough to get involved with Jaylan again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 id=h-is-leah-messer-single>Is Leah Messer Single?</h3><p>Despite frequent rumors to the contrary, it does not appear that Leah is involved in a romantic relationship at this time.</p><p>Insiders say the MTV star is focusing on her career and her family at the moment and has no desire to jump back into the dating pool.</p><p>After the way she was betrayed by Jaylan, we don’t blame her for being hesitant to get back out there!</p><h3 id=h-is-leah-messer-back-on-drugs>Is Leah Messer Back on Drugs?</h3><p><a href=#>Leah Messer has struggled with addiction</a> in the past, and recent turmoil in her personal life has led to reports that her substance abuse issues have resurfaced.</p><p>There does not appear to be any truth to those reports.</p><p><a href=#>Leah became addicted to opioids </a>in her twenties, and while she still drinks socially these days, she says her days of relying on prescription painkillers are far behind her.</p><p>We commend her for her strength in getting clean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 id=h-is-leah-messer-in-a-cult>Is Leah Messer In a Cult?</h3><p>During a dark time in her recent past, <a href=#>Leah Messer got involved with an organization known as Mastery in Transformational Training</a>, which many former members have described as a cult.</p><p><a href=#>Kailyn Lowry</a> and other friends encouraged Leah to cut ties with the group, and thankfully, it seems that she’s finally done so.</p><p>Recent troubles in her love life notwithstanding, Leah is reportedly in a very stable, happy place these days.</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t mean her life is without heartache …</p><h3 id=h-why-is-leah-messer-s-daughter-in-a-wheelchair>Why Is Leah Messer’s Daughter In a Wheelchair?</h3><p><a href=#>Leah Messer’s daughter Ali suffers from a disease</a> known as Titin Myotonic muscular dystrophy.</p><p>The illness, which is usually found in adults, has left the 13-year-old largely confined to a wheelchair.</p><p>Ali is not entirely immobile, but she uses a wheelchair when outside of the house in order to minimize the likelihood of harmful falls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Sadly, muscular dystrophy is a progressive disease that often gets worse with age.</p><p>But Ali has the benefit of a large support network made up of loved ones who would do anything for her.</p><p>Even critics of Leah’s have praised her for her obvious devotion to finding the best treatment options for her courageous daughter.</p><p>Yes, Leah has made some mistakes over the years but there’s no questioning her commitment to her kids.</p><p>And her parenting skills are made all the more impressive by the fact that she didn’t have many role models in that department.</p><h3 id=h-was-leah-messer-abused-by-her-mother>Was Leah Messer Abused By Her Mother?</h3><p><a href=#>Leah Messer survived an abusive childhood</a>, and she courageously spoke out about it in her 2020 memoir.</p><p>Leah revealed that her mother forced her to have sex with an older boy and coerced her into joining a neighborhood fight club.</p><p>Both of these traumatic incidents occurred before Leah had even entered her teens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Needless to say, the adults in her life failed Leah, and the odds were against her ever finding success and stability.</p><p>But Ms. Messer beat those odds, and now she’s set her daughters up for lifetimes of happiness and fulfillment.</p><p>Inspiring stories are hard to come by in the world of Teen Mom, but Leah is living proof that amazing things can happen under the most difficult circumstances.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation"
