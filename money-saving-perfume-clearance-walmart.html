It interacts immediately with your body chemistry so you will get a good sense of how it will smell on you.</p><p>"If you spray it on a piece of paper you won't get that," he added.</p><p>He also said it was best to wait five or ten minutes to see how it smells on you then.</p><p>That's when the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">top notes</a>, or the initial fragrance wears off.</p><p>You are left with the middle notes which typically last from two to four hours and make up the bulk of the fragrance.</p><p>The base notes usually last four to six hours and leave the residual effect of a fragrance.</p><p>Moorjani also says to store your perfumes carefully, avoiding heat and sunlight, and not to store them in the <a href=#>fridge</a>, which he says many people tend to do.</p><p>Above all the perfume expert said that "less is more" and while you want people to smell your fragrance and let it make an entrance as you do, you don't want it to overpower.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Here's more on how one Walmart superfan <a href=#>nabbed over $115</a> worth of groceries from the retailer for just $5.</p><p>Plus, one woman's Walmart <a href=#>fashion haul</a> that reminded her of clothes her mom wore when she was in high school.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfa312gJJsZ2iln6OyunnSmq2ippdivaa%2Bxa6knmWTobKivsCnmp5lp5a5rq3RrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
