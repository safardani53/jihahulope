The couple had a massive scare when Julia was taken to the hospital but thankfully nothing bad happened.</p><p>Nehdar is the husband of famous American actress Lacey Chabert. He has become a trending subject for movie fans, thanks to his marriage to Lacey.&nbsp;For those not in the know, Lacey Chabert is an amazing actress who started out as a child actress. Her big break came in the popular TV drama&nbsp;— Party of Five.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Lacey Chabert's Marriage: </strong>Lacey Chabert walks down Aisle with father during her wedding with David Nehdar in 2013&nbsp;(Photo: Instagram)</p><p>When a celebrity actress marries someone, it’s common that her fans start to get curious about who the particular person to their favorite actress could be.</p><p>That’s the case we have got here — but with a twist. David Nehdar is a very private person, which must disappoint Chabert’s fans. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He’s not in the acting business, that’s for sure. This makes it even harder to get information about him. He seems to be like some mythical creature only heard in folk tales and stories.</p><h2>'Batman' Gets Married To Lacey Chabert In Secrecy&nbsp;</h2><p>Despite being in a relationship for so long, no one knows the actual length of their relationship; no one knew the name, age or anything about this man. Spectators then&nbsp;started to kid around, saying that maybe he could be the Batman and that he hides in the Batcave below his significant other's real estate.</p><p>Some began to get serious speculations that perhaps he was a CIA or an FBI agent.</p><p><strong>Similar:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Jamie Orchard Bio: Secretly Married To Husband? Family Reflects</a></p><p>Lacey didn’t help either. She has held back when it comes to&nbsp;providing information about her man. For someone as active as her on social media, she has never&nbsp;posted any pictures&nbsp;of him.</p><p>Even until the bitter end when she announced the happy news on her Twitter account that she was marrying someone nobody knew about, she didn’t disclose his name.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m starting off 2014 as a Mrs! Over the holidays, my best friend & love of my life…we became husband & wife! #soblessed #love.”</p><p>Luckily, Chabert’s fans were persistent and with the help of the media, they started digging around only to discover a name: David Nehdar. A name, if searched on Google, would show up nothing. So that was a victory long lasted for them albeit a minor one. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fans then eagerly hoped and waited for award ceremonies or an exclusive red carpet event where he’d crawl out from the shadow to be by her side. But hope has since been just hope and nothing more. The man is literally a mystery.</p><h2>David Was Absent In Wife Lacey's Wedding Photos</h2><p>One can only guess how long David Nehdar and Lacey Chabert had been dating, but they tied the knot in the holiday season of 2013. Throughout all the period they dated, the couple kept their relationship very low key.</p><p>When they got married, even then, the media was unaware until Chabert herself revealed it to fans via Twitter. Even in the wedding photos that she shared with her fans, the groom was missing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The wedding was attended by the biggest who's who of Hollywood including American actress <a href=# rel=follow>Kaley Cuoco</a> and her sister, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Briana Cuoco</a>. A year later, in June to be precise, she spoke more about why she kept her wedding a secret.</p><p>She spoke about her husband’s privacy explaining that relationships are already hard enough without the opinion of strangers.</p><p>“I wanted it to be personal. He’s (David Nehdar) not in the business, and we like our privacy, and I just think relationships are hard enough without the opinion of strangers. So we try to keep it as personal and private as possible.”</p><p>But the fact that she’s supporting Nehdar shows that she genuinely loves him and has unwavering faith in him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Discover:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Christiane Amanpour From CNN: A Blessed Wedding That Got Her Husband And A Son</a></p><h2>David Nehdar & His Wife's Net Worth</h2><p>We really cannot be sure about what to make out about Lacey's and David's life.</p><p>Lacey is one of the top personalities of the industry whereas David is somewhat of a myth. We don't really know anything about him.</p><p>After Lacey and David got married in 2013, speculations continued about his profession on whether he was Batman and had billions worth of net worth, as compared to his wealthy wife Lacey&nbsp;— who has an estimated net worth of $10 million. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her most memorable films include Daddy Day Care (2003), Mean Girls (2004), Black Christmas (2006),&nbsp; and more. She has also acted in many Hallmark TV films.</p><h2>Wife Lacey Chabert Conceives Daughter At Age 32&nbsp;</h2><p>Three years after their marriage, in February 2016, Lacey Chabert announced on her Instagram account that she and her husband were expecting a baby. She shared a sweet Instagram snap of her chihuahua Kitty wearing a white T-shirt with the words,</p><p>'My mom is having a baby & all I get is this silly shirt.'</p><p>At the age of 32, Lacey gave birth to their first child. They welcomed a daughter named Julia on September 2nd, 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>David and Lacey were over the moon to become parents of Julia. Meeting their daughter for the first time was probably the most special moment of their marriage.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Sleeping Cutie: </strong>David Nehdar and her wife Lacey Chabert conceive their daughter in September of 2016&nbsp;(Photo: Instagram)<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Lacey is less secretive, unlike her husband, when it comes to her baby as well.</p><p>She has shared some photos of their cute baby girl on her Instagram account.&nbsp;</p><p>However, her husband, David Nehdar remains a mysterious figure.

She and her mother shared a close bonding of souls as well, and she's hoping for a similar relationship with her daughter.&nbsp;</p><h2>David Parents Daughter While His Wife Is Wedding On Screen</h2><p>The charming actress is in the euphoria of motherhood. But the motherhood has come at a cost of a challenged married life and profession. Lucky for her,&nbsp;she has a husband to lean on.&nbsp;</p><p>The new mother admitted in early June 2018 that the arrival of the baby daughter had cut off time between David and her with every day being full of joy and exhausting at the same time.</p><p>Parenting is a game of two hands and Lacey has not been shy to open&nbsp;up about her husband's support in that particular game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Inspiring:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Malala Yousafzai Facts: Nobel Award Winner's Inspiring Story, Quotes & Wisdom</a></p><p>Had it not been for David's support in parenting their daughter, she would have hardly made it back on the screen as early as September 2018.</p><p>She was quick enough to land back in movies starting from&nbsp;Hallmark Channel’s All Of My Heart: The Wedding.</p><p>She has even managed to look stunning in the portrayal of Jenny on the wedding set with on-screen husband&nbsp;Brennan Elliott —&nbsp; who starred as Brian.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Wedding Photo</strong>: Lacey Chabert wedding photo for the movie, All of My Heart: The Wedding&nbsp;(Photo: Channel Guide Magazine)</p><p>Hands down!
