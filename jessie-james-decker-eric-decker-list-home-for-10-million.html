The country singer, 34, and the former wide receiver, 35, have listed their four-bedroom, seven-bathroom mansion for $10.3 million, according to Compass online listings. The Deckers — who tied the knot in June 2013 — first moved into the house in 2019 with their three children: Vivianne, 8, Eric Jr., 7, and Forrest, 4.
James Decker has shared numerous glimpses into the family’s life inside their Tennessee residence over the years — and the Kittenish founder has a penchant for Christmas decor."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Night night, y’all❄️🥰🎄,” she wrote in the caption. In 2019, James Decker couldn’t resist decorating for the holidays early — and sharing a photo of their festive home.</p><p>“I personally like to wait [until] after Thanksgiving, but this year I gave in after the kids got so excited! First tree up, couple more to go🎄,” the “Wanted” singer wrote alongside a November 2019 photo of her husband and kids decorating a tree in the foyer.</p><p>The Deckers’ little ones made headlines in November 2022 when <a href=#>body-shamers criticized the children’s abs</a> in a photo James Decker shared via Instagram at the time.</p><p>“It’s a sad world we live in today when having healthy fit kids who are super active, play sports [and] build muscle naturally is ‘weird,’” the “I Still Love You” songstress replied to one commenter.</p><p>In response to another hater, the Eric & Jessie: Game On alum wrote, “From one mother to another. <a href=#>Please don’t call my children’s appearance strange</a> just because they don’t look the way you think they should? It’s unkind ❤️.”</p><p>The following day, James Decker continued to reflect on the backlash she had received.</p><p>“When I posted the pix of our vacation and included the kids being silly flexing on the beach on our Thanksgiving trip I had <a href=#>NO clue it would get the reaction it did</a>,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “But being accused of photoshopping abs on my kids (I can’t help but laugh) or … the polar opposite of ‘overtraining’ our kids makes me realize how bizarre our world has gotten regarding the body and what’s normal and what’s not.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the mom-shamers and a move on the horizon, the​ family is <a href=#>looking ahead to the future with smiles</a> on their faces. Decker shared a positive message for the new year alongside a Friday, January 6, <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram </a>photo of him and his wife clinking glasses.</p><p>“Looking forward to 23’ with you babe,” the NFL alum wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaOotqZ5yZqknqtdmbKkt8SrZJ6qmZh6pbHCpJyrZZyewLV5x6iknmWWpL9ufY9mpKKknJ68r3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
