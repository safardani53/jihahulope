health.</p><p>"<a href=#>Constipation </a>is linked to all sorts of other medical problems such as piles, diverticular disease and even an increased risk of bowel cancer if this is a long term issue."</p><p><a href=#>Piles</a>, or haemorrhoids, are lumps inside or around the bottom which can be itchy and bleed.</p><p>One of the main causes is straining on the toilet, which often happens when you are <a href=#>constipated</a>.</p><p>Piles typically get better on their own, but drinking plenty of fluids and eating lots of fibre can help, according to the NHS.</p><p>Similar habits can help prevent <a href=#>diverticular disease</a>, which affects the large intestine when small pockets develop in the lining.</p><p>It is usually managed with <a href=#>painkillers</a> or laxatives, but in rare cases it can lead to serious compilations, such as a build up of pus in the bowel, blockages, and perforations, which can require surgery or a colostomy.</p><p>Scientists have linked the chronic condition, and long-term constipation generally, to bowel cancer.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>A study by Aarhus University Hospital in <a href=#>Denmark</a> found the risk of the disease was 1.78 times higher in patients suffering from <a href=#>constipation</a> than those without.</p><p>But the evidence is mixed, and it only suggests an association, not causation.</p><p>Overall, experts recommend beating bowel problems, including constipation, by:</p><ul><li>Eating enough fibre (found in fruits, vegetables and cereals)</li><li>Drinking plenty of fluids</li><li>Avoiding alcohol</li><li>Staying active and not spending long periods sitting or lying down</li><li>Acting on urges to go to the toilet</li><li>Relieving stress, anxiety or depression</li><li>Resting your feet on a low stool while on the loo</li><li>Speaking to a pharmacist if diet and lifestyle changes aren't helping</li></ul><p>The NHS defines constipation as having three or fewer poos in a week, stools that are often large and dry or hard and lumpy, having to strain or experiencing pain on the loo.</p><p>'<a href=#>Caterpillar poos</a>' fall under this definition.</p><p>If you're not sure if your number two classifies as a <a href=#>caterpillar</a>, take a look at the <a href=#>Bristol Stool Chart</a>.</p><p>It's an easy way to identify what health problems you might be facing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RW-GRAPHIC-POO-CHARTv3.jpg><p>Developed in 1997, it describes seven types of poo and what each one means:</p><ul><li>Type 1: separate, hard lumps like nuts which are hard to pass</li><li>Type 2: sausage-shaped but lumpy</li><li>Type 3: like a sausage but with cracks on the surface</li><li>Type 4: smooth and soft like a sausage or snake</li><li>Type 5: soft blobs with clear-cut edges</li><li>Type 6: fluffy or mushy pieces with ragged edges</li><li>Type 7: watery or entirely liquid</li></ul><p>Types 1 to 2 indicate constipation, 3 to 4 are ideal, and 5 to 7 suggest diarrhoea and urgency.</p><p>Dr Jarvis said: "The Bristol Stool Chart is widely used by doctors to identify what your poos look like.</p><p>"They go from type 1 – very hard pellets, like rabbit droppings – to type 7 – an entirely liquid poo with no solid pieces.</p><p>"Types 6 and 7 usually mean you have a tummy bug or an inflammatory bowel problem, whereas types 1 and 2 are much more common and show you’re constipated."</p><p>You're aiming for a type 3 or 4, a smooth, soft sausage, which is easy to pass.</p><p>"Eating enough fibre, getting regular exercise and keeping your fluid intake up all contribute to this sort of poo," Dr Jarvis said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read
