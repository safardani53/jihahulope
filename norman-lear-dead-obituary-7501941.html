His family has also requested privacy at this time, and will hold a private service for immediate relatives, they said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The news was also confirmed on Lear's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>official Instagram account</a> beside a black-and-white photo of the television legend smiling. In the post, Lear's team said he died "surrounded by his family as we told stories and sang songs until the very end."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Norman lived a life in awe of the world around him. He marveled at his cup of coffee every morning, the shape of the tree outside his window, and the sounds of beautiful music. But it was people—those he just met and those he knew for decades—who kept his mind and heart forever young," the caption read. "As we celebrate his legacy and reflect on the next chapter of life without him, we would like to thank everyone for all the love and support."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A native of New Haven, Connecticut, Lear is best known for creating the groundbreaking comedy series, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All in the Family</a>, which broached social and political issues deemed controversial at the time.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before his successful career in entertainment, Lear joined the United States Army Air Forces in 1942, where he fought through World War II. He was discharged in 1945 and became a publicist, ultimately moving his career and family to California.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After transitioning into producing, Lear — who was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1984 — went on to create multiple iconic TV series that established a socially-realistic genre and explored his democratic values, including All in the Family, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman and The Jeffersons.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Norman Lear.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All in the Family — his sitcom which covered a multitude of issues, including prejudice, menopause, rape, homosexuality, sexual dysfunction and religion — earned 55 Emmy nominations and ultimately won 22 of them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lear's other notable shows include Maude, Good Times, Sanford and Son and Fernwood 2 Night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later in his career, Lear wanted to find another platform to express his political views and founded People for the American Way in 1981, a liberal coalition to defend core First Amendment freedoms. In 1991, he created the Business Enterprise Trust, a nonprofit that celebrated acts of integrity, courage and social vision in American businesses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a doting husband and father of six, Lear is survived by wife Lyn and children Ellen (with ex-wife Charlotte Rosen), Kate and Maggie (with ex-wife Frances Loeb), and Benjamin, Madelaine and Brianna (with Lyn).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Norman Lear.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jesse Grant/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lear's death comes after he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated his 101th birthday in July</a>. The revered TV creator marked his centenary plus one with a reflective yet playful video posted on his&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Good morning and good afternoon, good evening, depending on where you are, who you are,” Lear began, before breaking out laughing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s Norman Lear here, dribbling a bit because he’s entering his second childhood,” the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>One Day at a Time</a>&nbsp;creator joked. “I’ve just turned 101, and that is, they tell me, my second childhood.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, “It feels like that because of the kind of care I’m getting. I get the kind of care at this age that I see children getting, toddlers getting. And so I am now a 101-year-old toddler.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Norman Lear with wife Lyn Lear.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lear also marked his birthday by writing an impassioned op-ed in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Washington Post</a>, in which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>he called for better protection of voting rights</a> and spoke about his time serving in the Army.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"To legislators getting between people and the ballot box, and to senators who are standing in the dishonorable tradition of those who filibustered civil rights legislation, I say this: You may pass some unjust laws. You may win elections by preventing or discouraging people from voting," he wrote in the piece. "But you will not, in the end, defeat the democratic spirit, the spirit that animated the Tuskegee airmen to whom I owe my life, the spirit that powers millions of Americans who give of themselves to defend voting rights, protect our environment, preserve peaceful pluralism, defeat discrimination, and expand educational and economic opportunity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The right to vote is foundational to addressing all these issues. It is at the heart of everything I have fought for in war and in peacetime," he added. "Protecting voting rights should not be today's struggle. But it is. And that means it is our struggle, yours and mine, for as long as we have breath and strength."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In lieu of flowers or gifts, Lear's representatives say he requested contributions be made to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People For the American Way</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ56kv66tzWajnpmiYrGmrcNmppuhpKqus8WMcGxpaWlpfg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
