Henry Cavill opened up about his extreme transformation for The Witcher — and that he had to majorly cut back on water for his diet.
“That’s the worst part of it,” Cavill, 36, said during a recent appearance on The Graham Norton Show. “Like, diet is difficult, and you’re hungry, but when you are dehydrating for three days, you get to the point on the last day where you can smell water nearby."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He began doing fasted cardio to help lose weight fast and show off his muscles.</p><p>“It’s some of the best — or most enjoyable cardio — I’ve done,” he told <a href=#>Men’s Health UK</a> in September. “It’s only 20 minutes, so it’s not massively exhausting. It’s not like doing HIIT, which, psychologically, can be quite grueling. My heart rate’s at 125-135bpm, so it has a really good effect on fat-loss.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While he trained hard for past roles — including Man of Steel and Mission: Impossible — Fallout — he swears by the new workout regimen.</p><p>“Out of all the things I’ve done in the past, I think the fasted cardio stuff is actually working best for me,” he admitted. “I’m in the best shape of my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGahnZ6nxm6vwK%2BgpaRdmMK1ec6uq2avkamys3nFqKlmq5iev7W4xKyqZq%2BZqbCpsdFmqpydnprAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
