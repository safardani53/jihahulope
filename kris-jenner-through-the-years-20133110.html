But when you’re in something, sometimes people think the grass is always greener and that was like what I think I went through at some point.”</p><p>Jenner and Kardashian went on to have four children together: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Rob Kardashian.</strong></a> However, the pair divorced in March 1991 after Jenner had an affair. In March 2020, the momager admitted on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Diane von Furstenberg</strong></a>‘s “InCharge With DVF” podcast that her “biggest regret was the fact that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> it broke up my family.”</a></p><p>“I didn’t know what to do. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I had four kids</a>, I was single. I didn’t know where I was going to live,” she explained. “I didn’t know how I was going to make a living. It was the scariest time to be that young. I think I was 32 years old, and I had four little children. My son was maybe a year old and it was scary. I was really, really scared. I remember picking myself up by my bootstraps one day. I have deep faith in God and I just started praying that God would strengthen me, give me that power, give me the ability to be in charge of my own life. It was my turn to really grow up.”</p><p>However, Jenner remained on good terms with Robert until his death in July 2003 from esophageal cancer.</p><p>Jenner was married to Olympian<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>Caitlyn Jenner</strong></a> from 1991 until <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their split in 2013.</a> The pair are the parents of daughters <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kendall </strong></a>and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Kylie Jenner.</strong></a></p><p>The California native is the manager for all six of her children and even trademarked the term “momager” in 2017. The Kardashian-Jenner family became household names after the premiere of their E! reality series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> in 2007. The show<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> became a pop culture phenomenon </a>and cemented Kris’ status as the ultimate boss lady.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s annoying when I hear, ‘What do your girls do?’ Well, first of all, all of my daughters have jobs,” Kris told Redbook Magazine in 2011. “They are fashion stylists and designers; they own a chain of stores. They had the stores before they had the show. And my kids worked from the time they were 13 years old. So, to me, that’s a huge misconception that the girls don’t work. They work 25 hours a day.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Kris’ evolving look throughout the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuLO10mahnqaemr9uwMerpq6fmGLBqbGMspyaqqNif3F9kmxoamhf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
