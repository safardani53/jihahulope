rel="noreferrer noopener">@bella.inizio</a>) has garnered over 270,000 followers on TikTok, where she shares her latest finds.</p><p>She usually wears a UK size 12/14 [US 8/10] and stands at 5-foot-4.</p><p>She took to the social media platform to reveal the stylish clothes in her latest shopping haul, but things took an unexpected turn.</p><p>“It’s time for an honest midsize Asos haul,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>CUT OUT DRESS</h2><p>Jade started the video by trying on an eye-catching midi dress with a twist cut-out.</p><p>It is no longer available on the website but a similar style of <a href=# aria-label="dress (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">dress</a> in black costs $17.</p><p>“This is a beautiful dress, but are you ready to see how far I can spread my legs,” she said.</p><p>She attempted to take a side step but was unable to move her legs even shoulder width apart.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fashion</h2></p><p>The fashionista then waddled back and forth across the room to show how rigid the material of the dress was.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s it so I couldn’t run in an emergency,” she joked. “I hope there’s no fires.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>BRIGHT GREEN SKIRT</h2><p>Jade continued the shopping haul with <a href=# aria-label="Asos (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Asos</a> Design’s structured mini-suit skirt in lime green.</p><p>It had been reduced on the website from $22 to $7.75 before stock sold out in all sizes.</p><p>“Zero points,” she said as the zip on the side refused to go up.</p><p>She posed from the front to show how the skirt would’ve looked if it was able to fasten properly.</p><p>As she spun around, it was evident the skirt was also shorter than she had anticipated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

attempted to try on Motel’s grunge V-neck midi <a aria-label="dress (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">dress</a> with daisy print.</p><p>The $66 dress is no longer available after shoppers went wild for it in sizes XS to XL.</p><p>Jade was unable to get the floral print dress past her hips despite repeatedly pulling on the fabric.</p><p>She sighed and huffed before giving up on getting it to fit her curvy figure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Asos Design’s flare crochet <a href=# aria-label="mini dress (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">mini dress</a> which cost $52.</p><p>“She’s cute, she’s aetherial it’s only when you realize that my boobs finish here,” she said.</p><p>She put her hands across her chest to reveal the knitted design finished higher than it was supposed to.</p><p>“Why does the material finish halfway across my boobs,” she raged. “I don’t even have big boobs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

shopping haul with Sisters of The Tribe flared <a href=# aria-label="pants (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">pants</a> for $21 and the matching <a href=# aria-label="top (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">top</a> for $16.</p><p>She was left unimpressed by the small size of the top which failed to cover her breasts and the sheer material of the pants.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re exposed, very vulnerable like if I yank up just a touch too high… nips,” she said.</p><p>“And then these are completely see-through," she said, pointing at the bottoms.</p><p>"I’ve managed to find the right shade of pants but they are completely see-through. Nah.”</p><p>Jade captioned the post, writing: “Not everything’s a hit [laughing].”</p><p>The video went viral with over 469,000 views and thousands of likes from people who were amused by her wardrobe woes.</p><p>Many viewers took to the comment section reassuring Jade that she had a “killer body” while blasting Asos’s sizing.</p><p>“You are healthy and gorgeous. It’s the designer and producers who are out of touch and got it all wrong,” one person wrote.</p><p>“You have a KILLER body girl! Absolutely beautiful,” a second said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“I’m midsize and hate Asos, the clothes never fit right,” a third chimed in.</p><p>“I’m literally going to buy like three of these bits now for my holiday because they look so good on you,” another added.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/e4ab03b6-4450-4546-9bf0-15134838738f.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FuaWxxZGeDcLnInaqispVirrS70mafmq2cYrOitctmm6udo6h6o7vOm6pmmpmcfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
