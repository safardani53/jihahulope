From the way the 23-year-old actress looked on Friday (Feb. 26), she had already skipped Spring and was in full-on beach mode. Ariel, in a sharp blue-and-white tie-dye bikini, took in some sun and sand while walking the shoreline in Santa Barbara. In the photos – <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>which you can see here</a> </strong>– Ariel is enjoying <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her best life</a>, and she has her best man, boyfriend <strong>Luke Benward</strong>, by her side.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ariel kept on a loose floral kimono to ward off the late-February chill (though temperatures are in the high 60’s F, it’s still winter after all.) She also got a bit ‘cheeky’ while skipping stones in the waves, her bikini riding high to show off her backside. During the fun trip, Ariel wrapped her arms around Luke in a sweet moment of PDA. Later, she was seen reading a copy of <strong>Abigail Dean</strong>’s bestseller, Girl A, while lounging on a beach chair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ariel-winter-bf-luke-Benward-beach-pda-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Ariel and Luke’s beach trip comes nearly a month after he took her on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a romantic picnic</a> in honor of her 23 rd birthday. “A birthday picnic for my bunny:))))),” Luke captioned an Instagram photo of him planting a kiss on Ariel’s lips, their picnic spread out underneath an overcast sky. “I love you so much. You are so life giving and such a beautiful soul. The world needs what you have to offer, and so do I [heart emoji] another year around the sun with you, and it feels so good :) happy birthday, buns. I love you.” He also shared a picture of him goofing off in front of the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ariel-winter-bf-luke-Benward-beach-pda-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Luke and Ariel have been a couple <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>since December 2019</a>. The two have endured the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 together. They were “going strong, and they’ve definitely discussed their future together,” a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>source</a> shared with <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>EXCLUSIVELY in July. Ariel “sees long-term potential” with Luke, which means spending the rest of her life with him. Marriage, according to the insider, “been a topic of discussion.” At the time, Luke’s youngest sister, <strong>Gracie</strong>, had just gotten engaged, and Luke – like any good big brother – didn’t want to steal her thunder by proposing. “So, [there are] doubts Luke would be popping the question anytime soon,” shared the insider, but judging by this beach trip, Ariel is having the time of her life without a ring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e49qZpqqmZq5bsPIp6ueql2ptqZ5w7KcZpqZoLavtYybnJqbmGKxosDEZqOuo5Vir6a61pqpnWWgnby1u9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
