She cashed in on her Octomom fame with the photo shoot and the sex tape and said she earned $8,000 from the tape. She received media backlash for her choices, but Suleman said, “It was just to put food on the table and just to take care of my family.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I wasn’t me and I’m sorry. I’m sorry for anyone I hurt out there,” she said. “I look back in retrospect, and I would never say I regret not one of my children. They are why I live.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also said she struggled with the sedative Xanax after she began taking it in 2012.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gilbert Carrasquillo/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I ended up numbing that shame,” Suleman revealed. “So in order to be something that I was not, I had to numb myself to do so.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She said that she relapsed almost immediately after a stint in rehab, and that the incident with her 10-year-old daughter prompted her to make a change that would last.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days Suleman works part-time as a family therapy counselor.
