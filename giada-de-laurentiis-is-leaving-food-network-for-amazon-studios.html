Her maternal grandfather, film producer Dino De Laurentiis, was an icon of Italian cinema. When her first Food Network series debuted, Giada believed it was “different from all the other shows” on the channel at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Nothing was really shot on location, and all of them were in New York City. … I don’t have the personality to do a studio show,” she explained. “So the Food Network said, ‘OK, we’ve never done this before, but let’s try it,’ and they rented a house to shoot in. So we weren’t in my own home, but it was close by, and it gave the show a warm, homey feeling, and I could bring my family and friends in and do fun entertaining on the show.”</p><p>The Happy Cooking author shares daughter Jade, 14, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Todd Thompson</strong></a>. The former couple were married from 2003 to 2015. She has since moved on with TV producer <a href=#><strong>Shane Farley</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6imZSWeqWxjKWYrqqVo8GqtdJmoKxlnJqut7XNoGSfp5%2BZeq%2Bx07Cmq6Ndm7yzecCmmLOnnmLAtcHDoqasZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
