The Blades had not won at Stamford Bridge since 1992 or kept a clean sheet there since 1922, but seemed like they may break that run considering the Blues first half display.
However, a vastly improved second half saw Raheem Sterling and Cole Palmer spark Chelsea into life, with Palmer getting a goal and assist thanks to Sterling's brilliant work on both."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Showed a lack of bravery on the ball and often too easily beaten when defending.</p><p>This being said, his height proved useful in dealing with the aerial threat posed by the Blades.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Thiago Silva - 6</h2><p>Saw a few passes go awry when trying to switch play. Compounded the sloppiness of the Chelsea defence in the first half on the ball.</p><p>Experience helped Chelsea manage the game, not that there was a whole lot of threat he was up against.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Benoit Badiashile - 7</h2><p>Imposing throughout the game and a large part of why Chelsea faced <span id=1f20fa1f-e281-4780-a2b6-5579fe9c11d7 class=suggested-link>next</span> to no threat from <a href=#>Sheffield United</a>.</p><p>Will have sterner tests coming up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Levi Colwill - 6</h2><p>Calm and reliable at left-back but lacked bravery on the ball until the second half. Having two CB's as full-backs play in traditional roles doesn't offer much in the way of excitement in the modern game.</p><p>Nevertheless, another solid performance from the 20-year-old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conor Gallagher - 7</h2><p>Set the Chelsea mood early on by showing tigerish intent to win the back high, with one turnover yielding a shot from the Blues captain and another which should have seen more if not for Raheem Sterling's poor decision to not play a pass.</p><p>Involved in both goals as he first slipped a pass into Sterling before then getting his boot on a high ball to allow Sterling to poke the ball towards Palmer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/conor-gallagher-chelsea-premier-league-866705061.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moises Caicedo - 6</h2><p>Poor decision 27 minutes in to play in the offside Jackson when the opportunity for a shot was open.</p><p>Picked up some better positions after the break which elevated Chelsea's ability to progress the ball.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Raheem Sterling - 8</h2><p>A passenger for much of the first half and when he was involved in play seemed to kill a number of promising attacks by cutting back but did produce two dangerous cut backs from the right wing late in the first half.</p><p>Moved more central in the second half and instantly looked more of a threat before creating the opener for Cole Palmer to tap in. Some scrappy but determined play from allowed the ball to fall to Palmer before he squared it for Jackson to tap in. Subbed after 75 minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-sun-22-23-touch-map-4ffbd7a9-29c2-4a76-a0a2-7d4f5714db10.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cole Palmer - 9</h2><p>Forced to drop deeper than he would have liked in the first half due to the lack of progression being produced by those behind him but looked instantly better in the second half and would have scored if not for a courageous block.</p><p>Sniffed out the danger in the area for the opener on Sterling's cut back and laid on the goal for Jackson. He and Sterling were a class apart following the break.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mykhailo Mudryk - 6</h2><p>Clever ball across the penalty area in the first half deserved someone to be on the end of it, showed some bright moments but including a nutmeg before firing blazing a shot towards the corner flag.</p><p>More reserved role to play in the second half with Sterling getting on the ball more often before he was hooked in the 69th minute for Enzo Fernandez.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nicolas Jackson - 5</h2><p>Seemed to be offside whenever he received the ball in the first half but was unfortunate to see one chance swept up bravely by <a href=#>Wes Foderingham</a> when he would have been through on goal before flashing a shot wide off the post later on.</p><p>Tapped in a goal in the second half to bring his goal tally for the season to eight. Goal flattered an otherwise poor display.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Subs</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Enzo Fernandez (on for Mudryk 69 minutes) - 6</h2><p>Solid after coming on yet not mind blowing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Armando Broja (on for Sterling 75 minutes) - 3</h2><p>Showed his rustiness by missing a sitter from close range that would have been the third of the game.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ian Maatsen (on for Palmer 90+4 minutes) - N/A</h2><p>Not enough time to do anything of note.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Malo Gusto (on for Jackson 90+4 minutes) - N/A</h2><p>Not enough time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-sun-22-23-match-stats-9bc8fd91-b3ec-4e69-8ab6-53c90da5ef04.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fJZubGpsX5i1prjSnphmq5ias6e1xKWbZq2ensGmsIypo5qxlad6s63ToqWgq12iwqW%2B2KRkrKyVp7mqusZmpaStnqDCcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
