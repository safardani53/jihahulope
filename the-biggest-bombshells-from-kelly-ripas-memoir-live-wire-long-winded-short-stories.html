She adds that she was "invited back to the show many times, but always declined." (He did appear in a 2015 Halloween episode though.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>She went to therapy after becoming unhappy at work</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ripa sought therapy after she believed she was suffering from depression but her therapist informed that she thought her job was making her "miserable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At that time, a different time, a pre-#metoo #timesup time, a pre-women belong in the room where decisions are being made, I.

So did my crow's feet."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There were things that really bothered me about my appearance. I smile and laugh a lot, which is good emotionally but terrible when it comes to laugh lines," she continues.
