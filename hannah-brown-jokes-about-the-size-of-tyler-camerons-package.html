The former Bachelorette star, 25, and Cameron, 27, spent another day keeping themselves entertained with their “quarantine crew” amid the global coronavirus pandemic on Saturday, March 21. This time the pair dressed up in Superman costumes while they worked out with personal trainer Phil Fit.

I know he looks decent but, in all seriousness, he’s a true gentleman. He’s a good man, so if those two people find each other and they’re happy, I stan that. I ship that. I do all the things the kids are saying these days.”</p><p>He added, “I just wish them well. Can you still do that? Can I just wish them happiness in these crazy times? Look, if nothing else comes of this, maybe two great people that I love a lot fall in love — or not! Maybe they’re just quarantining together and they’re finding happiness in a weird quarantine time.”</p><p>Brown and Cameron have been self-isolating together with their friends in Florida since an eyewitness spotted the former general contractor picking up Brown at the airport on March 13.
