has popped up, and it promises to deliver all the ease and affordability of tiny living without sacrificing on design and aesthetics.</p><p>In a <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">new video</a>, TikToker Stephen Martinez, a realtor who goes under the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">@Realtor_Stephen_Martinez</a> username, showed off the new tiny home village.</p><p>The homes have a starting sale price of $140,000, making them far cheaper than a traditional housing unit, which often runs from $300,000 or more.</p><p>“I’m curious to see what they look like because we’re not used to this style,” Stephen said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about tiny homes">Read more about tiny homes</h2><p>City-wide, there are three communities featuring tiny homes within San Antonio, but few have fully embraced the tiny home lifestyle.</p><h2>INSIDE THE COMMUNITY</h2><p>As Stephen entered one of the first tiny homes on the block, the house welcomed him with a full driveway and pillars surrounding a light blue lot home.</p><p>Stephen said all of the units were not designed for large families, so you have to keep this in mind when considering if you’d be able to make a tiny home lifestyle work.</p><p>Instead, they work great for working professionals and empty nesters, who often don’t need as much space to live the vibrant lives they want without a huge amount of material items.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>The home tour included a personal look into a full kitchen space with a wide window for airy light.</p><p>The kitchen also comes with granite countertop and a full sink and oven.</p><p>“To be honest, they’re really not that bad especially if you live in other cities where space is at a premium,” the realtor shared with his thousands of followers.</p><p>For instance, a studio in New York City often only provides around 500 square feet while costing $3,500 in rent, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">according to RentHop.</a></p><p>And with the minimum size of a studio being only 150 square feet, the tiny homes available in San Antonio can appear quite impressive.</p><p>Stephen said the tiny homes available in San Antonio are also energy-efficient, making them even more affordable in the long run.</p><p>Due to their energy efficiency, your monthly cost could come around to roughly $1,200 based on a typical mortgage payment.</p><p>That’s very similar to the price of a one-bedroom apartment in the area.</p><p>“Except here you own instead of rent,” Stephen said. “It has everything one needs.”</p><p>Also included in the set up is a full-sized bathroom with granite countertops, a shower and stackable washer and dryer connections.</p><p>The loft area you can use as your bedroom is “actually a cool space,” Stephen said.</p><p>“I’m almost six feet tall, and there’s plenty of room above my head,” the TikToker added as he walked around the spacious bedroom area.</p><p>Even in a tiny home space, you don’t have to skimp out on what you love if you’re an outdoorsy individual.</p><p>Outside the tiny home’s interior, Stephen walked into a large backyard, which provided ample room to set up a playground, play fetch with your dog or even just host an outdoor barbecue.</p><p>Each neighborhood offers pool and playground amenities as well, making the buildings a solid option if you have a smaller family.</p><p>“If you need someplace affordable, this is not a bad idea,” Stephen said.</p><p>There are also several incentives available if you do decide to purchase a tiny home in San Antonio.</p><p>That includes fully covered closing costs.</p><p>Or, for a few hundred dollars more, you can get something bigger or more traditional, Stephen said.</p><p>Still, there are many advantages that come alongside tiny home ownership, including a simpler lifestyle and lower monthly payments.</p><p>“Stop paying rent because it’s all about home ownership, San Antonio,” Stephen said at the end of his video.</p><h2>A NATIONAL TREND</h2><p>Several other tiny home villages have been popping up around the country as developers recognize the demand for low-cost, minimalist housing.</p><p>In Elizabethtown, <a href=#>Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=#>Tiny Estates</a> offers 58 tiny homes, and rent begins at just $650.</p><p>At first, the space operated more like a hotel, but owner Abby Shank said over time, it became the community it is today, far different from its past as a mobile home park.</p><p>“Everybody kind of has a different lifestyle and a reason for having their tiny home, but it’s created this nice, well-rounded sense of community,” Abby said.</p><p>The space includes a community garden, firepit, mailbox space and laundry facilities.</p><p>Meanwhile, in <a href=#>Wilmington, North Carolina,</a> the Eden Village offers a solution for homelessness,&nbsp; providing a 32-unit tiny home community for those who fit the criteria of “chronically homeless.”</p><p>To live in the village, you also must have a physical or mental illness that makes you a high cost burden to the public.</p><p>Once approved, you’ll pay only a small portion of your monthly earnings.</p><p><a href=#>Orlando, Florida</a> has also built a tiny home community with rent as low as $350.</p><p>The Orlando Lakefront at College Park community officially launched in 2015 when the 1950s RV park transformed into an upscale tiny home village.</p><p>“We offer available lots to tiny housers who wish to legally park, live on the shores of a beautiful lake and take advantage of all that a nearby metropolitan area has to offer,” said Adam Money, the owner of Orlando Lakefront.</p><p>To date, 27 RVs and 23 small houses line the property, but many more are interested in joining the tiny home neighborhood.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Here’s <a href=#>another tiny home community</a> where rent starts at just $700, but the waitlist is already growing.</p><p>Some tiny home enthusiasts have gotten their monthly expenses even lower, including <a href=#>one woman</a> who built her home from the ground up but now pays only $250 for the custom house.</p><p class=postsid
