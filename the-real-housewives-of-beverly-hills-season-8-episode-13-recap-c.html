No, this is not How to Get Away with Murder, but the editing certainly made it seem it was.&nbsp;</p><p>We quickly found out that Lisa Rinna&nbsp;(Who is still a cast member, by the way!) and Teddi were having a day to themselves. They were indulging in some pedicures.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s when Rinna&nbsp;admitted that things with Dorit were finally on the up and that they bonded over champagne flutes. We kid over that last part, but still, they’re friends!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Then Teddi felt like it was her duty to report back about Dorit and PK trashing Lisa three months before at that big dinner party. Yeah, we’re not sure why three-month-old&nbsp;comments were brought back up, but Teddi needs an ally.&nbsp;</p><p>Rinna was quick to point out that she was done listening to all of it because she knew they had said it and she was ready to put the past behind her.&nbsp;</p><p>Teddi is an accountability coach, so it made sense that she would want Dorit to take responsibility for her actions. However, bringing up drama that happened months ago seemed like a desperate attempt to hog the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe Teddi is trying to be nice, but she has no idea what show this is. Everything is manipulated, and a narrative is created. Unfortunately, her edit is not coming out like an oil painting.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/erika-girardi-slash-jayne-675x1024.jpg><p>Aside from that, not much else happened away from the big fight that was teased at the opening of the hour.&nbsp;</p><p>When we got to that night, Teddi called up Dorit and asked if they could make their way to the event together so that they could chat about their differences.&nbsp;</p><p>That did not go well, and Teddi asked Dorit to keep quiet about their fight because she didn’t want another fight to ruin another dinner party.&nbsp;</p><p>Dorit was not ready to agree, and we found out the hard way that she was not ready to pull any punches when it came to the ladies being the presence of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Teddi was made to look like the bad one because she brought it all back up. But talking things out is in Teddi’s nature, so it made sense for her to act that way.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That’s when Teddi struck at Erika because she was playing a game.&nbsp;</p><p>"You pretending that it’s full amnesia right now is confusing to me,” said Teddi with a grin.&nbsp;</p><p>“No, excuse me, don’t ever say I’m pretending, because I’m not pretending," Erika barked back.</p><p>"I’m telling you the truth, I don’t remember saying that. Don’t ever say that to me again, don’t f— with me like that — you don’t want that. Don’t ever, EVER do that to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Yeah, these ladies are now more fractured than ever, but how long will it be before they all makeup and realize they’ve been fighting for an absurd reason?</p><p>Hit the comments below.&nbsp;</p><p>You can <a href=#>watch The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills online</a> right here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills continues Tuesdays on Bravo.&nbsp;</strong></p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>14 Shadiest Real Housewives Hook-Ups of All-Time</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WAcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmmZ6ulae5unnHoqOlq12osqK%2FzqdkcWWVpba0u8OeZGprXaeypK3PZppo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
