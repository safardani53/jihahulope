The comedian and former cast member of the show hosted the episode and sang a song called “I’m Just Pete,” which was a parody of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barbie</a>‘s “I’m Just Ken,” sung by <strong>Ryan Gosling</strong> in the role of Ken, as he sat shirtless on a pink couch. He showed off blonde hair, like the movie’s main male character, and wore a teal and pink shirt with pink pants at some points during the sketch.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The song started after a sad Pete overheard SNL&nbsp;costars <strong>Andrew Dismukes</strong> and <strong>Punkie Johnson</strong> making fun of him in the office. “Yeah, why is he hosting?” Andrew asked. “He just left and it’s not like his show was a hit,” he added, referring to Pete’s show Bupkis. “Right, like how you get<strong> Joe Pesci</strong> and <strong>Edie Falco</strong> and no viewers?” Punkie replied before they both laughed.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Pete proceeded to go off and sing his sad song, which included lyrics like, “No one cares about the work I do, I made a show with Joe Pesci too and no one streamed it but my mom.” He continued with a lyric that mentioned SNL cast member <strong>Colin Jost</strong>.&nbsp;“When I’m high, I do things like call up Colin Jost, and say ‘Home, we should buy a boat.’ They tell me I have butthole eyes but I never sleep alone at night,” he hilariously sang.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Backup dancers eventually joined him for the song and the catchy chorus included lyrics like, “I’m just Pete, anyone else I’d be a three, but I guess I’m hot for dudes in comedy, because it’s an ugly industry.” Pete also poked fun at his romantic history with <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> and the drama between her ex-husband<strong> Kanye West </strong>by singing, “I’m just Pete, looking like a meth head on the street, people online still call me Skete because of a guy whose name I can’t say legally.” Kanye’s face flashed on the screen at that point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pete-davidson-parody-barbie-ken-song-snl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>After Pete got attention for his Ken sketch, he was photographed attending an SNL afterparty at Catch Steak with his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>girlfriend <strong>Madelyn Cline</strong></a>.
