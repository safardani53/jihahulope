Due to the limited information, fans have become more curious about his father’s background.</strong></p><p>But, they will still have to wait until the 28 years old shed light on his parents’ details.</p><p>And that day doesn’t appear to be approaching anytime soon, as Wood is known for his private nature. He prefers to keep his personal life closely guarded.&nbsp;</p><p>This is evident from his social media presence, where he refrains from sharing much about his personal life.</p><p>And the likelihood of his family making public appearances remains exceedingly slim for the time being.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Christian-Wood-During-A-Press-Conferece-After-A-Match-In-September-2021.jpg></p><p>Having played for multiple franchises during his professional journey, Wood is one of the most successful players in the NBA.</p><p>Today, he moved on from the Dallas Mavericks and agreed to a two-year deal to join the <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles Lakers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Last summer, he was traded to Dallas for the remaining year of his three-year.&nbsp;</p><p>Though he had a disappointing season with Dallas, Wood remains a reliable center, boasting a career three-point shooting percentage of nearly 38%.</p><h2>Christian Wood Parents</h2><p>Wood was born on September 27, 1995, in Long Beach, California.&nbsp;</p><p>He was raised alongside two siblings by his mother, Jeanette Stewart. His brother goes by the name Derek Stewart, while his sister’s identity remains confined.&nbsp;</p><p>Per his Twitter <a href=# rel=noopener>post</a>, his father seems to have passed away, leaving all the responsibility to him and his mother.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Christian-Wood-Tweet-From-2018-Suggest-That-His-Father-Is-No-Longer-WIth-Him.jpg></p><p>The posts that date back to January 5, 2018, suggest that his father is no longer with the Wood Family. However, the exact date of his father’s passing remains uncertain.</p><p>Nevertheless, Jeanette Stewart has shown remarkable strength in raising three children independently, a testament to her resilience and dedication.</p><p>She has been giving her 100 percent day in and day out and has been there for them every step of the way.&nbsp;</p><h2>Supportive Mother By His Side</h2><p>The 2015 NBA draft marked a turning point in Wood’s life, and not in a positive way.</p><p>Despite his hopes, he was not chosen by any team, making it one of the most disappointing moments in his career.</p><p>His friends and family were present at the Fizz Lounge at Caesars Palace to celebrate, unaware that he would ultimately go undrafted.</p><p>As he didn’t go on the first round as expected, he tweeted,</p><p>“Just waiting for my name to get called.”</p><p>A couple of tweets then followed, but nothing happened.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gary-Parrish-a-CBS-columnist-Tweets-About-Christian-Wood-Not-Making-It-To-The-NBA-Draft-In-June-2015.jpg></p><p>Heartbroken, Wood left the party with his sister to a nearby casino, where he expressed his apologies to his mother.</p><p>“Mom, I’m sorry, I’m a failure.”</p><p>Stewart, being a supportive mother, stood resolute before him and assured him that he was not a failure.</p><p>With comforting words, she encouraged him to lift his head high and brush away those tears.</p><p>Wood found solace in her words, reassured that his path forward in his career would ultimately be a successful one.</p><h2>Who Is He Dating?</h2><p>After a tragic night at the NBA draft, he was dumped by his ex-girlfriend, making things worse.</p><p>The now 28 years old shared that he never saw his after the draft.&nbsp;</p><p>“I lost my girlfriend that night, too. I dropped her off at the airport after the draft and never saw her again.”&nbsp;</p><p>As of 2023, rumors have been swirling about his romantic involvement with Maya Benberry.</p><p>These speculations gained traction as she dropped subtle hints on her social media, such as liking his posts and expressing wishes for his recovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCvx6ugrKyZlrtuw86om2aokaeyr8DSZqSenaRiwKq6xqWcZqWfqbWmvoyjnJqmlanBpnnSrZywmaKpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
