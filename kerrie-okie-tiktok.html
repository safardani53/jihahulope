As it turns out, that's exactly the case for Kerri Okie.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Kerri Okie?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerri Okie</a> is a TikTok mom who has become well-known on the social media channel for posting funny videos that are focused on her regular life. She has more than 1.5 million followers, and some of her videos have been viewed more than 10 million times. Kerri, who is from Oklahoma City, films all of her videos with help from her daughter, and just recently, she had a major brush with the spotlight.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">One of Kerri's videos was featured on 'Inside Edition.'</h2><p>Most recently, Kerri has become the subject of curiosity because one of her videos was featured on Inside Edition, the daily pop culture news program. The video in question had already been viewed more than 8 million times and featured Kerri's daughter pulling a prank on her by locking her out of her car. Kerri's daughter filmed her trying to get back in and then told her she would have to dance to be admitted.</p><p>Kerri decides to play along, and the results are as hilarious as her daughter likely hoped they would be. Now, that video has been featured on Inside Edition, making it even more likely to become well-known online.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kerri isn't thrilled with the publicity she's received.</h2><p>There are likely plenty of people who would be thrilled to be featured on national TV, but Kerri definitely isn't one of them. Her daughter filmed a video call with Kerri in which she broke the news that their video had been featured on Inside Edition, and Kerri didn't take the news all that well.</p><p>“Are you sitting down mom, because we were on Inside Edition. The TV show,” her daughter said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“No we weren’t, I watch that show all the time and I didn’t see nothing about us being on no national show," Kerri replied. "How did I miss it I watch it all the time? When was it on there?”</p><p>Her daughter then revealed that the video that had been played was the car dancing video, and Kerri only got more distraught from there.</p><p>“Well isn’t that just Jim dandy. You made me dance and it went on national TV. Are you serious? I wish I’d smacked you with that wag bar whilst I could’ve,” she said, referencing the original video.</p><p>“That is a national show, how embarrassing… I was dancing,” she continued.</p><p>Kerri may have been fine to mess around with her daughter, but she clearly never thought she'd wind up on Inside Edition. Now that she has, it seems that she's not totally thrilled by the increased publicity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKzvsieZKijmZp6tbXKraak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
