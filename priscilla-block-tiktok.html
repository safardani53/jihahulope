Her song “Thick Thighs” caught the attention of millions of TikTok users and her fanbase has grown exponentially seemingly overnight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is TikTok sensation Priscilla Block?</h2><p>Priscilla has been compared to Miranda Lambert and Kacey Musgraves, but what she sings and writes is a style all her own. She takes all the great things about country music, including the art of storytelling, and combines them with messages of self-love and empowerment.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>On her song, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Thick Thighs,”</a> she encourages women to embrace their bodies, no matter their shape or size. “I can’t be the only one who likes extra fries over exercise / I never eat the produce that I buy, so why even try / You can’t spell diet without die / I’ve been eating carbs since ’95 / And I’ve heard thick thighs save lives,” she sings on the chorus.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Her song “Just About Over You” is currently on the Billboard charts.</h2><p>After sharing a softer side with her single “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Just About Over You</u></a>,” the song shot up to the No.1 spot on the all-genre iTunes chart, surpassing superstars such as Billie Eilish, Harry Styles, and Dan + Shay. While the song is heartbreaking, she is thankful for the heartache because it led to the success she’s seeing.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@priscillablock href=#>@priscillablock</a><p><a title=greenscreen href=#>##greenscreen</a> @morganwallen FREAKING SANDWICH ON THE CHARTS.

It’s real life,” she tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Country Now</u></a>. “I’ve been through a time when I thought that I was over somebody and then you see them or their mom reaches out to you. Anything that sets you back a little bit. I think everyone can relate in some way.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She credits her sudden success to the loyalty of country music fans.</h2><p>Priscilla’s overnight success is as baffling to her as it is for everyone else. However, she does believe in the power of a loyal fanbase. “I am absolutely overwhelmed,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rolling Stone</u><u>.</u></a> “I still have no words. I’ve always heard that country music fans are ride or die … and this right here proves it. This is six years of blood, sweat, and tears.”&nbsp;</p><p>After she dropped the song, her listeners on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a> increased by around 550 percent within 24 hours, Mary Catherine Kinney, an executive on Spotify’s Artist & Label Partnerships team, told Rolling Stone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpb%2Bqv8Kio6WZXZe5sK%2FKZquio6SkuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
