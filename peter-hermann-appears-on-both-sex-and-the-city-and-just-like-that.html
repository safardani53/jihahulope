One of Hermann’s early acting roles was as a suitor of Charlotte York’s (Kristin Davis) during the sixth and final season of SATC, which was conceived by Darren Star. 
Fresh off her breakup from eventual husband Harry Goldenblatt (Evan Handler), Charlotte — who had converted to Judaism for Harry amid their courtship — was set up by several members of her synagogue’s ladies club."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

One of their prime candidates was David (played by Hermann) in the 2004 episode, “Hop, Skip, and a Week.” Charlotte eventually ended their conversation abruptly when <a href=#>she realized Harry was The One</a> and their connection wouldn’t lead to anything substantial. Harry, for his part, walked into the temple moments later to win Charlotte back and he proposed. (The <a href=#>twosome are still married</a>, and parents of two, in&nbsp;<i>And Just Like That</i>.)</p><p>While Hermann, 55, did not get the girl on <i>Sex and the City</i>, he returned to the universe 20 years later for a brief arc on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>And Just Like That</i></a>. Hermann portrayed&nbsp;a<i>&nbsp;</i>love interest for Carrie Bradshaw (<a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a>) in the&nbsp;Thursday, July 13, episode&nbsp;when Carrie <a href=#>collided with Hermann’s George while walking </a>on the sidewalk. George, a software engineer who was riding a bicycle at the time, went flying over the handlebars and shouted at Carrie for getting in his way and causing him to break his wrist. After she took him to urgent care, they enjoyed a brief flirtation before heading back to his apartment for a romantic encounter. Carrie and George’s dalliance was ultimately interrupted by a FaceTime call from his business partner, who delivered an urgent work deadline.</p><p class=p1>While David and George do not have a connection besides an uncanny physique, <i>Sex and the City </i>author <a href=#><strong>Candace Bushnell</strong></a> offered her own relatable theory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Peter-Hermann-Was-In-SATC-Before-And-Just-Like-That-Candace-Bushnell-Offers-Solid-Reasoning-377.jpg><p class=p1>“The fact that Carrie’s app designer boyfriend is the same guy that Charlotte was set up with at the synagogue in season 6<b>&nbsp;</b>really speaks to the lack of eligible bachelors in New York City,” Bushnell, 64 — who <a href=#>penned the novels that inspired</a> Star’s OG series — jokingly<a href=#> tweeted</a> on Wednesday, July 19.</p><p class=p1>While<b>&nbsp;</b>Star,&nbsp;64, is not involved in&nbsp;<i>And Just Like That&nbsp;</i>— <a href=#><strong>Michael Patrick King</strong> </a>took over the role of showrunner — he did cast Hermann on another TV series:&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Younger</i></a>.

So I loved being able, in a three-piece suit, to take on life in a more structured way. That always felt like a real luxury.”</p><p class=p1><i>New episodes of And Just Like That drop Thursdays on Max.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeerJWneqmx0aaYp6Zdlr2xscCrqmannmKvsMDHZqqesF2Wu6V506GcZpuZqcZurc2dZKOto6l6rbXKnmStoJGpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
